<p></p>
<i>Enter RODERIGO and OTHELLO</i>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.1">Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly</span><br>
<span name="1.1.2">That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</span><br>
<span name="1.1.3">As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.4">'Sblood, but you will not hear me:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.5">If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.6">Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.7">Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.8">In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.9">Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.10">I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.11">But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.12">Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</span><br>
<span name="1.1.13">Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.14">And, in conclusion,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.15">Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.16">'I have already chose my officer.'</span><br>
<span name="1.1.17">And what was he?</span><br>
<span name="1.1.18">Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.19">One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.20">A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.21">That never set a squadron in the field,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.22">Nor the division of a battle knows</span><br>
<span name="1.1.23">More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.24">Wherein the toged consuls can propose</span><br>
<span name="1.1.25">As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.26">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.27">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</span><br>
<span name="1.1.28">At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</span><br>
<span name="1.1.29">Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</span><br>
<span name="1.1.30">By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.31">He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.32">And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</span><br>
<br>
