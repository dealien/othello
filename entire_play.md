<h3>ACT I</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</i>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.1">Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly</span><br>
<span name="1.1.2">That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</span><br>
<span name="1.1.3">As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.4">'Sblood, but you will not hear me:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.5">If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.6">Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.7">Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.8">In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.9">Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.10">I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.11">But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.12">Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</span><br>
<span name="1.1.13">Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.14">And, in conclusion,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.15">Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.16">'I have already chose my officer.'</span><br>
<span name="1.1.17">And what was he?</span><br>
<span name="1.1.18">Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.19">One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.20">A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.21">That never set a squadron in the field,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.22">Nor the division of a battle knows</span><br>
<span name="1.1.23">More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.24">Wherein the toged consuls can propose</span><br>
<span name="1.1.25">As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.26">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.27">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</span><br>
<span name="1.1.28">At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</span><br>
<span name="1.1.29">Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</span><br>
<span name="1.1.30">By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.31">He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.32">And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.33">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.34">Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.35">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.36">And not by old gradation, where each second</span><br>
<span name="1.1.37">Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.38">Whether I in any just term am affined</span><br>
<span name="1.1.39">To love the Moor.</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.40">I would not follow him then.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.41">O, sir, content you;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.42">I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.43">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</span><br>
<span name="1.1.44">Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</span><br>
<span name="1.1.45">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.46">That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.47">Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.48">For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.49">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</span><br>
<span name="1.1.50">Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.51">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.52">And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.53">Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</span><br>
<span name="1.1.54">their coats</span><br>
<span name="1.1.55">Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.56">And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.57">It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.58">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.59">In following him, I follow but myself;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.60">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.61">But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.62">For when my outward action doth demonstrate</span><br>
<span name="1.1.63">The native act and figure of my heart</span><br>
<span name="1.1.64">In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</span><br>
<span name="1.1.65">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</span><br>
<span name="1.1.66">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.67">What a full fortune does the thicklips owe</span><br>
<span name="1.1.68">If he can carry't thus!</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.69">Call up her father,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.70">Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.71">Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.72">And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.73">Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.74">Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.75">As it may lose some colour.</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.76">Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.77">Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</span><br>
<span name="1.1.78">As when, by night and negligence, the fire</span><br>
<span name="1.1.79">Is spied in populous cities.</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.80">What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.81">Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!</span><br>
<span name="1.1.82">Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!</span><br>
<span name="1.1.83">Thieves! thieves!</span><br>
<p><i>BRABANTIO appears above, at a window</i></p>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.84">What is the reason of this terrible summons?</span><br>
<span name="1.1.85">What is the matter there?</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.86">Signior, is all your family within?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.87">Are your doors lock'd?</span><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.88">Why, wherefore ask you this?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.89">'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on</span><br>
<span name="1.1.90">your gown;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.91">Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.92">Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</span><br>
<span name="1.1.93">Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.94">Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.95">Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.96">Arise, I say.</span><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.97">                  What, have you lost your wits?</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.98">Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</span><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.99">Not I	what are you?</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.100">My name is Roderigo.</span><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.101">The worser welcome:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.102">I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.103">In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</span><br>
<span name="1.1.104">My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.105">Being full of supper and distempering draughts,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.106">Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come</span><br>
<span name="1.1.107">To start my quiet.</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.108">Sir, sir, sir,--</span><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.109">                  But thou must needs be sure</span><br>
<span name="1.1.110">My spirit and my place have in them power</span><br>
<span name="1.1.111">To make this bitter to thee.</span><br>
<br>

<br>
<span name="1.1.112">Patience, good sir.</span><br>

<span name="1.1.114">My house is not a grange.</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.115">Most grave Brabantio,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.116">In simple and pure soul I come to you.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.117">'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not</span><br>
<span name="1.1.118">serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to</span><br>
<span name="1.1.119">do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll</span><br>
<span name="1.1.120">have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.121">you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have</span><br>
<span name="1.1.122">coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.</span><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.123">What profane wretch art thou?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.124">I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter</span><br>
<span name="1.1.125">and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</span><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.126">Thou art a villain.</span><br>

<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.129">Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.130">If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.131">As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.132">At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.133">Transported, with no worse nor better guard</span><br>
<span name="1.1.134">But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.135">To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--</span><br>
<span name="1.1.136">If this be known to you and your allowance,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.137">We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.138">But if you know not this, my manners tell me</span><br>
<span name="1.1.139">We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</span><br>
<span name="1.1.140">That, from the sense of all civility,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.141">I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.142">Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.143">I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.144">Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</span><br>
<span name="1.1.145">In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</span><br>
<span name="1.1.146">Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.147">If she be in her chamber or your house,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.148">Let loose on me the justice of the state</span><br>

<span name="1.1.151">Give me a taper! call up all my people!</span><br>
<span name="1.1.152">This accident is not unlike my dream:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.153">Belief of it oppresses me already.</span><br>

<span name="1.1.155">Farewell; for I must leave you:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.156">It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.157">To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--</span><br>
<span name="1.1.158">Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.159">However this may gall him with some cheque,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.160">Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd</span><br>
<span name="1.1.161">With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.162">Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.163">Another of his fathom they have none,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.164">To lead their business: in which regard,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.165">Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.</span><br>
<span name="1.1.166">Yet, for necessity of present life,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.167">I must show out a flag and sign of love,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.168">Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.169">Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.170">And there will I be with him. So, farewell.</span><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
<p><i>Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches</i></p>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.171">It is too true an evil: gone she is;</span><br>
<span name="1.1.172">And what's to come of my despised time</span><br>
<span name="1.1.173">Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.174">Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!</span><br>
<span name="1.1.175">With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!</span><br>
<span name="1.1.176">How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me</span><br>
<span name="1.1.177">Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:</span><br>
<span name="1.1.178">Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?</span><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.179">Truly, I think they are.</span><br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span name="1.1.180">O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!</span><br>
<span name="1.1.181">Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds</span><br>
<span name="1.1.182">By what you see them act. Is there not charms</span><br>
<span name="1.1.183">By which the property of youth and maidhood</span><br>
<span name="1.1.184">May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,</span><br>
<span name="1.1.185">Of some such thing?</span><br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>

<span name="1.3.31">That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,</span><br>

<span name="1.3.90">The very head and front of my offending</span><br>

<span name="1.3.95">Their dearest action in the tented field,</span><br>

<span name="1.3.109">To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!</span><br>

<span name="2.3.381">Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:</span><br>

<span name="2.3.384">Two things are to be done:</span><br>
<span name="2.3.385">My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;</span><br>
<span name="2.3.386">I'll set her on;</span><br>
<span name="2.3.387">Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,</span><br>
<span name="2.3.388">And bring him jump when he may Cassio find</span><br>

<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.1">Masters, play here; I will content your pains;</span><br>
<span name="3.1.2">Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'</span><br>

<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.3">Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.4">that they speak i' the nose thus?</span><br>
<br>

<b>First Musician</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.5">How, sir, how!</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.6">Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?</span><br>
<br>

<b>First Musician</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.7">Ay, marry, are they, sir.</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.8">O, thereby hangs a tail.</span><br>
<br>

<b>First Musician</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.9">Whereby hangs a tale, sir?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.10">Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.</span><br>
<span name="3.1.11">But, masters, here's money for you: and the general</span><br>
<span name="3.1.12">so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's</span><br>
<span name="3.1.13">sake, to make no more noise with it.</span><br>
<br>

<b>First Musician</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.14">Well, sir, we will not.</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.15">If you have any music that may not be heard, to't</span><br>
<span name="3.1.16">again: but, as they say to hear music the general</span><br>
<span name="3.1.17">does not greatly care.</span><br>
<br>

<b>First Musician</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.18">We have none such, sir.</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.19">Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:</span><br>
<span name="3.1.20">go; vanish into air; away!</span><br>
<p><i>Exeunt Musicians</i></p>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.21">Dost thou hear, my honest friend?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.22">No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.23">Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece</span><br>
<span name="3.1.24">of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends</span><br>
<span name="3.1.25">the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's</span><br>
<span name="3.1.26">one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:</span><br>
<span name="3.1.27">wilt thou do this?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.28">She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I</span><br>
<span name="3.1.29">shall seem to notify unto her.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.30">Do, good my friend.</span><br>
<p><i>Exit Clown</i></p>
<p><i>Enter IAGO</i></p>
<span name="3.1.31">In happy time, Iago.</span><br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.32">You have not been a-bed, then?</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.33">Why, no; the day had broke</span><br>
<span name="3.1.34">Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.35">To send in to your wife: my suit to her</span><br>
<span name="3.1.36">Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona</span><br>
<span name="3.1.37">Procure me some access.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.38">I'll send her to you presently;</span><br>
<span name="3.1.39">And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor</span><br>
<span name="3.1.40">Out of the way, that your converse and business</span><br>
<span name="3.1.41">May be more free.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.42">I humbly thank you for't.</span><br>

<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.45">Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry</span><br>
<span name="3.1.46">For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.</span><br>
<span name="3.1.47">The general and his wife are talking of it;</span><br>
<span name="3.1.48">And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.49">That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.50">And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom</span><br>
<span name="3.1.51">He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you</span><br>
<span name="3.1.52">And needs no other suitor but his likings</span><br>
<span name="3.1.53">To take the safest occasion by the front</span><br>
<span name="3.1.54">To bring you in again.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.55">Yet, I beseech you,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.56">If you think fit, or that it may be done,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.57">Give me advantage of some brief discourse</span><br>
<span name="3.1.58">With Desdemona alone.</span><br>
<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.59">Pray you, come in;</span><br>
<span name="3.1.60">I will bestow you where you shall have time</span><br>
<span name="3.1.61">To speak your bosom freely.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.62">I am much bound to you.</span><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
<br>
<h3>SCENE II. A room in the castle.</h3>
<p></p><br>
<i>Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen</i>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.2.1">These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;</span><br>
<span name="3.2.2">And by him do my duties to the senate:</span><br>
<span name="3.2.3">That done, I will be walking on the works;</span><br>
<span name="3.2.4">Repair there to me.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.2.5">Well, my good lord, I'll do't.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.2.6">This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?</span><br>

<h3>SCENE III. The garden of the castle.</h3>
<p></p><br>
<i>Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA</i>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.1">Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do</span><br>
<span name="3.3.2">All my abilities in thy behalf.</span><br>
<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.3">Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.4">As if the case were his.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.5">O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.6">But I will have my lord and you again</span><br>
<span name="3.3.7">As friendly as you were.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.8">Bounteous madam,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.9">Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.10">He's never any thing but your true servant.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.11">I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.12">You have known him long; and be you well assured</span><br>
<span name="3.3.13">He shall in strangeness stand no further off</span><br>
<span name="3.3.14">Than in a polite distance.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.15">Ay, but, lady,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.16">That policy may either last so long,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.17">Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.18">Or breed itself so out of circumstance,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.19">That, I being absent and my place supplied,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.20">My general will forget my love and service.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.21">Do not doubt that; before Emilia here</span><br>
<span name="3.3.22">I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.23">If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it</span><br>
<span name="3.3.24">To the last article: my lord shall never rest;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.25">I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.26">His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.27">I'll intermingle every thing he does</span><br>
<span name="3.3.28">With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.29">For thy solicitor shall rather die</span><br>
<span name="3.3.30">Than give thy cause away.</span><br>
<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

<b>CASSIO</b>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.33">Why, stay, and hear me speak.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.34">Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.35">Unfit for mine own purposes.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.36">Well, do your discretion.</span><br>
<p><i>Exit CASSIO</i></p>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.37">Ha! I like not that.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.38">What dost thou say?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.39">Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.40">Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.41">Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.42">That he would steal away so guilty-like,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.43">Seeing you coming.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.44">                  I do believe 'twas he.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.45">How now, my lord!</span><br>
<span name="3.3.46">I have been talking with a suitor here,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.47">A man that languishes in your displeasure.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.48">Who is't you mean?</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.49">Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.50">If I have any grace or power to move you,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.51">His present reconciliation take;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.52">For if he be not one that truly loves you,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.53">That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.54">I have no judgment in an honest face:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.55">I prithee, call him back.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.56">Went he hence now?</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.57">Ay, sooth; so humbled</span><br>
<span name="3.3.58">That he hath left part of his grief with me,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.59">To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.60">Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.61">But shall't be shortly?</span><br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

<span name="3.3.65">To-morrow dinner, then?</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.66">I shall not dine at home;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.67">I meet the captains at the citadel.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.68">Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.69">On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.70">I prithee, name the time, but let it not</span><br>
<span name="3.3.71">Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.72">And yet his trespass, in our common reason--</span><br>
<span name="3.3.73">Save that, they say, the wars must make examples</span><br>
<span name="3.3.74">Out of their best--is not almost a fault</span><br>
<span name="3.3.75">To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?</span><br>
<span name="3.3.76">Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.77">What you would ask me, that I should deny,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.78">Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.79">That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.80">When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.81">Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do</span><br>
<span name="3.3.82">To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.83">Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.84">I will deny thee nothing.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.85">Why, this is not a boon;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.86">'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.87">Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.88">Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit</span><br>
<span name="3.3.89">To your own person: nay, when I have a suit</span><br>
<span name="3.3.90">Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.91">It shall be full of poise and difficult weight</span><br>
<span name="3.3.92">And fearful to be granted.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.93">I will deny thee nothing:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.94">Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.95">To leave me but a little to myself.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.96">Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

<b>IAGO</b>

<b>IAGO</b>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

<span name="3.3.121">Think, my lord!</span><br>
<span name="3.3.122">By heaven, he echoes me,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.123">As if there were some monster in his thought</span><br>
<span name="3.3.124">Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.125">I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.126">When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?</span><br>

<span name="3.3.128">In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'</span><br>
<span name="3.3.129">And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.130">As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</span><br>
<span name="3.3.131">Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.132">Show me thy thought.</span><br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

<span name="3.3.135">And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.136">And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.137">Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.138">For such things in a false disloyal knave</span><br>
<span name="3.3.139">Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just</span><br>
<span name="3.3.140">They are close delations, working from the heart</span><br>
<span name="3.3.141">That passion cannot rule.</span><br>

<span name="5.2.336">O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.337">Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.338">What shall be said to thee?</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="5.2.339">Why, any thing:</span><br>
<span name="5.2.340">An honourable murderer, if you will;</span><br>
<span name="5.2.341">For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.</span><br>
<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>
<br>
<span name="5.2.342">This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:</span><br>

<span name="5.2.345">Dear general, I never gave you cause.</span><br>

<span name="5.2.346">I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.</span><br>
<span name="5.2.347">Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil</span><br>
<span name="5.2.348">Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

<span name="5.2.349">Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:</span><br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>
<br>
<span name="5.2.354">Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.355">Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter</span><br>
<span name="5.2.356">Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;</span><br>
<span name="5.2.357">And here another: the one of them imports</span><br>
<span name="5.2.358">The death of Cassio to be undertook</span><br>
<span name="5.2.359">By Roderigo.</span><br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="5.2.360">O villain!</span><br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="5.2.361">Most heathenish and most gross!</span><br>
<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>
<br>
<span name="5.2.362">Now here's another discontented paper,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.363">Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.364">Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;</span><br>
<span name="5.2.365">But that belike Iago in the interim</span><br>
<span name="5.2.366">Came in and satisfied him.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

<span name="5.2.367">O the pernicious caitiff!</span><br>
<span name="5.2.368">How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief</span><br>
<span name="5.2.369">That was my wife's?</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="5.2.370">I found it in my chamber:</span><br>
<span name="5.2.371">And he himself confess'd but even now</span><br>
<span name="5.2.372">That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose</span><br>
<span name="5.2.373">Which wrought to his desire.</span><br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="5.2.375">There is besides in Roderigo's letter,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.376">How he upbraids Iago, that he made him</span><br>
<span name="5.2.377">Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came</span><br>
<span name="5.2.378">That I was cast: and even but now he spake,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.379">After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.380">Iago set him on.</span><br>

<span name="5.2.381">You must forsake this room, and go with us:</span><br>
<span name="5.2.382">Your power and your command is taken off,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.383">And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.384">If there be any cunning cruelty</span><br>
<span name="5.2.385">That can torment him much and hold him long,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.386">It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.387">Till that the nature of your fault be known</span><br>

<span name="5.2.390">I have done the state some service, and they know't.</span><br>
<span name="5.2.391">No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.392">When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.393">Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.394">Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak</span><br>
<span name="5.2.395">Of one that loved not wisely but too well;</span><br>
<span name="5.2.396">Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought</span><br>
<span name="5.2.397">Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.398">Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away</span><br>
<span name="5.2.399">Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.400">Albeit unused to the melting mood,</span><br>
<span name="5.2.401">Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees</span><br>
<span name="5.2.402">Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;</span><br>
