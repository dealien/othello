<h3>ACT V</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. Cyprus. A street.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter IAGO and RODERIGO</i>

<b>IAGO</b>

Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:<br>
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:<br>
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:<br>
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,<br>
And fix most firm thy resolution.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.<br>
<p><i>Retires</i></p>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

I have no great devotion to the deed;<br>
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:<br>
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,<br>
And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,<br>
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,<br>
Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,<br>
He calls me to a restitution large<br>
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,<br>
As gifts to Desdemona;<br>
It must not be: if Cassio do remain,<br>
He hath a daily beauty in his life<br>
That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor<br>
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:<br>
No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.<br>
<p><i>Enter CASSIO</i></p>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!<br>
<p><i>Makes a pass at CASSIO</i></p>

<b>CASSIO</b>

That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,<br>
But that my coat is better than thou know'st<br>
I will make proof of thine.<br>
<p><i>Draws, and wounds RODERIGO</i></p>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

O, I am slain!<br>
<p><i>IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit</i></p>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!<br>
<p><i>Falls</i></p>
<p><i>Enter OTHELLO</i></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

O, villain that I am!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

It is even so.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,<br>
That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!<br>
Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,<br>
And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.<br>
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;<br>
Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
<p><i>Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO</i></p>

<b>CASSIO</b>

What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

O, help!<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Hark!<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

O wretched villain!<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:<br>
These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe<br>
To come in to the cry without more help.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Hark!<br>
<p><i>Re-enter IAGO, with a light</i></p>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

We do not know.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

                  Did not you hear a cry?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What's the matter?<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What are you here that cry so grievously?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!<br>
Give me some help.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I think that one of them is hereabout,<br>
And cannot make away.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

O treacherous villains!<br>
What are you there? come in, and give some help.<br>
<p><i>To LODOVICO and GRATIANO</i></p>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

O, help me here!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

That's one of them.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

O murderous slave! O villain!<br>
<p><i>Stabs RODERIGO</i></p>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--<br>
How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--<br>
What may you be? are you of good or evil?<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

As you shall prove us, praise us.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Signior Lodovico?<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

He, sir.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

Cassio!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

How is't, brother!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

My leg is cut in two.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Marry, heaven forbid!<br>
Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.<br>
<p><i>Enter BIANCA</i></p>

<b>BIANCA</b>

What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Who is't that cried!<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,<br>
Cassio, Cassio!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect<br>
Who they should be that have thus many led you?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

No.<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,<br>
To bear him easily hence!<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash<br>
To be a party in this injury.<br>
Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;<br>
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?<br>
Alas my friend and my dear countryman<br>
Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

What, of Venice?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Even he, sir; did you know him?<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

Know him! ay.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;<br>
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,<br>
That so neglected you.<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

I am glad to see you.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

Roderigo!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

He, he 'tis he.<br>
<p><i>A chair brought in</i></p>
O, that's well said; the chair!<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

Some good man bear him carefully from hence;<br>
I'll fetch the general's surgeon.<br>
<p><i>To BIANCA</i></p>
For you, mistress,<br>
Save you your labour. He that lies slain<br>
here, Cassio,<br>
Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

None in the world; nor do I know the man.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

[To BIANCA]  What, look you pale? O, bear him out<br>
o' the air.<br>
<p><i>CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off</i></p>
Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?<br>
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?<br>
Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.<br>
Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:<br>
Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,<br>
Though tongues were out of use.<br>
<p><i>Enter EMILIA</i></p>

<b>EMILIA</b>

'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Cassio hath here been set on in the dark<br>
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:<br>
He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,<br>
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.<br>
<p><i>To BIANCA</i></p>
What, do you shake at that?<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

I am no strumpet; but of life as honest<br>
As you that thus abuse me.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

As I! foh! fie upon thee!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.<br>
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.<br>
Emilia run you to the citadel,<br>
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.<br>
Will you go on? I pray.<br>
<p><i>Aside</i></p>
This is the night<br>
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
<h3>SCENE II. A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep;</h3>

a light burning.<br>
<p><i>Enter OTHELLO</i></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--<br>
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--<br>
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;<br>
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,<br>
And smooth as monumental alabaster.<br>
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.<br>
Put out the light, and then put out the light:<br>
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,<br>
I can again thy former light restore,<br>
Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,<br>
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,<br>
I know not where is that Promethean heat<br>
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,<br>
I cannot give it vital growth again.<br>
It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.<br>
<p><i>Kissing her</i></p>
Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade<br>
Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.<br>
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,<br>
And love thee after. One more, and this the last:<br>
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,<br>
But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;<br>
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Who's there? Othello?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ay. Desdemona.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Will you come to bed, my lord?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Ay, my lord.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

If you bethink yourself of any crime<br>
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,<br>
Solicit for it straight.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:<br>
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;<br>
No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Talk you of killing?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ay, I do.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Then heaven<br>
Have mercy on me!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Amen, with all my heart!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Hum!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then<br>
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,<br>
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Think on thy sins.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

                  They are loves I bear to you.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ay, and for that thou diest.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

That death's unnatural that kills for loving.<br>
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?<br>
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:<br>
These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,<br>
They do not point on me.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Peace, and be still!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I will so. What's the matter?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee<br>
Thou gavest to Cassio.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

No, by my life and soul!<br>
Send for the man, and ask him.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Sweet soul, take heed,<br>
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Ay, but not yet to die.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Yes, presently:<br>
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;<br>
For to deny each article with oath<br>
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception<br>
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Then Lord have mercy on me!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I say, amen.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

And have you mercy too! I never did<br>
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio<br>
But with such general warranty of heaven<br>
As I might love: I never gave him token.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.<br>
O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,<br>
And makest me call what I intend to do<br>
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:<br>
I saw the handkerchief.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

He found it then;<br>
I never gave it him: send for him hither;<br>
Let him confess a truth.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

He hath confess'd.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

What, my lord?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

That he hath used thee.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

How? unlawfully?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ay.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

He will not say so.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

No, his mouth is stopp'd;<br>
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge<br>
Had stomach for them all.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Down, strumpet!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Nay, if you strive--<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

But half an hour!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Being done, there is no pause.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

But while I say one prayer!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

It is too late.<br>
<p><i>He stifles her</i></p>

<b>EMILIA</b>

[Within]  My lord , my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?<br>
I that am cruel am yet merciful;<br>
I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

[Within]  What, ho! my lord, my lord!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Who's there?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

[Within]  O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.<br>
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--<br>
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?<br>
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--<br>
I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?<br>
If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:<br>
My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.<br>
O insupportable! O heavy hour!<br>
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse<br>
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe<br>
Should yawn at alteration.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

[Within]  I do beseech you<br>
That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;<br>
Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.<br>
Where art thou?<br>
<p><i>Unlocks the door</i></p>
<p><i>Enter EMILIA</i></p>
What's the matter with thee now?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What, now?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

But now, my lord.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

It is the very error of the moon;<br>
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,<br>
And makes men mad.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian<br>
Call'd Roderigo.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Roderigo kill'd!<br>
And Cassio kill'd!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

No, Cassio is not kill'd.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,<br>
And sweet revenge grows harsh.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

O, falsely, falsely murder'd!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Alas, what cry is that?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

That! what?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.<br>
Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!<br>
Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

A guiltless death I die.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

O, who hath done this deed?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Nobody; I myself. Farewell<br>
Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!<br>
<p><i>Dies</i></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Why, how should she be murder'd?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Alas, who knows?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

You heard her say herself, it was not I.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

She said so: I must needs report the truth.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:<br>
'Twas I that kill'd her.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

O, the more angel she,<br>
And you the blacker devil!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

She was false as water.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Thou art rash as fire, to say<br>
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.<br>
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,<br>
But that I did proceed upon just grounds<br>
To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

My husband!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Thy husband.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

That she was false to wedlock?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,<br>
If heaven would make me such another world<br>
Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,<br>
I'ld not have sold her for it.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

My husband!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

          Ay, 'twas he that told me first:<br>
An honest man he is, and hates the slime<br>
That sticks on filthy deeds.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

My husband!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,<br>
My husband say that she was false!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

He, woman;<br>
I say thy husband: dost understand the word?<br>
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

If he say so, may his pernicious soul<br>
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:<br>
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ha!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Do thy worst:<br>
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven<br>
Than thou wast worthy her.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Peace, you were best.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Thou hast not half that power to do me harm<br>
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!<br>
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--<br>
I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,<br>
Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!<br>
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!<br>
<p><i>Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others</i></p>

<b>MONTANO</b>

What is the matter? How now, general!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,<br>
That men must lay their murders on your neck.<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

What is the matter?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:<br>
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:<br>
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:<br>
Speak, for my heart is full.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I told him what I thought, and told no more<br>
Than what he found himself was apt and true.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

But did you ever tell him she was false?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I did.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;<br>
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.<br>
She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:<br>
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--<br>

<b>All</b>

O heavens forfend!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

And your reports have set the murder on.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

'Tis a strange truth.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

O monstrous act!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

                  Villany, villany, villany!<br>
I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--<br>
I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--<br>
O villany, villany!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:<br>
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.<br>
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O! O! O!<br>
<p><i>He falls on the bed</i></p>

<b>EMILIA</b>

       Nay, lay thee down and roar;<br>
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent<br>
That e'er did lift up eye.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

[Rising]  O, she was foul!<br>
I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,<br>
Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:<br>
I know this act shows horrible and grim.<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:<br>
Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief<br>
Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,<br>
This sight would make him do a desperate turn,<br>
Yea, curse his better angel from his side,<br>
And fall to reprobation.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows<br>
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame<br>
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:<br>
And she did gratify his amorous works<br>
With that recognizance and pledge of love<br>
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:<br>
It was a handkerchief, an antique token<br>
My father gave my mother.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

O heaven! O heavenly powers!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Come, hold your peace.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!<br>
No, I will speak as liberal as the north:<br>
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,<br>
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Be wise, and get you home.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

I will not.<br>
<p><i>IAGO offers to stab EMILIA</i></p>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

Fie!<br>
Your sword upon a woman?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of<br>
I found by fortune and did give my husband;<br>
For often, with a solemn earnestness,<br>
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,<br>
He begg'd of me to steal it.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Villanous whore!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,<br>
And I did give't my husband.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Filth, thou liest!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.<br>
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool<br>
Do with so good a woman?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Are there no stones in heaven<br>
But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!<br>
<p><i>He runs at IAGO  IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit</i></p>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,<br>
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:<br>
Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,<br>
But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,<br>
For 'tis a damned slave.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO</i></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I am not valiant neither,<br>
But ever puny whipster gets my sword:<br>
But why should honour outlive honesty?<br>
Let it go all.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

What did thy song bode, lady?<br>
Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.<br>
And die in music.<br>
<p><i>Singing</i></p>
Willow, willow, willow,--<br>
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;<br>
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;<br>
So speaking as I think, I die, I die.<br>
<p><i>Dies</i></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I have another weapon in this chamber;<br>
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--<br>
O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

[Within]  If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:<br>
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Look in upon me then and speak with me,<br>
Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.<br>
<p><i>Re-enter GRATIANO</i></p>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

What is the matter?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Behold, I have a weapon;<br>
A better never did itself sustain<br>
Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,<br>
That, with this little arm and this good sword,<br>
I have made my way through more impediments<br>
Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!<br>
Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.<br>
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;<br>
Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,<br>
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.<br>
Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;<br>
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,<br>
And he retires. Where should Othello go?<br>
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!<br>
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,<br>
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,<br>
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!<br>
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!<br>
Whip me, ye devils,<br>
From the possession of this heavenly sight!<br>
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!<br>
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!<br>
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!<br>
Oh! Oh! Oh!<br>
<p><i>Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair, and Officers with IAGO, prisoner</i></p>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

That's he that was Othello: here I am.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.<br>
If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.<br>
<p><i>Wounds IAGO</i></p>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Wrench his sword from him.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;<br>
For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,<br>
Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,<br>
What shall be said to thee?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Why, any thing:<br>
An honourable murderer, if you will;<br>
For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:<br>
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ay.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Dear general, I never gave you cause.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.<br>
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil<br>
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:<br>
From this time forth I never will speak word.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

What, not to pray?<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

                  Torments will ope your lips.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Well, thou dost best.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,<br>
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter<br>
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;<br>
And here another: the one of them imports<br>
The death of Cassio to be undertook<br>
By Roderigo.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O villain!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Most heathenish and most gross!<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Now here's another discontented paper,<br>
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,<br>
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;<br>
But that belike Iago in the interim<br>
Came in and satisfied him.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O the pernicious caitiff!<br>
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief<br>
That was my wife's?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I found it in my chamber:<br>
And he himself confess'd but even now<br>
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose<br>
Which wrought to his desire.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O fool! fool! fool!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

There is besides in Roderigo's letter,<br>
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him<br>
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came<br>
That I was cast: and even but now he spake,<br>
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,<br>
Iago set him on.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

You must forsake this room, and go with us:<br>
Your power and your command is taken off,<br>
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,<br>
If there be any cunning cruelty<br>
That can torment him much and hold him long,<br>
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,<br>
Till that the nature of your fault be known<br>
To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Soft you; a word or two before you go.<br>
I have done the state some service, and they know't.<br>
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,<br>
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,<br>
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,<br>
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak<br>
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;<br>
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought<br>
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,<br>
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away<br>
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,<br>
Albeit unused to the melting mood,<br>
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees<br>
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;<br>
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,<br>
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk<br>
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,<br>
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,<br>
And smote him, thus.<br>
<p><i>Stabs himself</i></p>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

O bloody period!<br>

<b>GRATIANO</b>

                  All that's spoke is marr'd.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;<br>
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.<br>
<p><i>Falls on the bed, and dies</i></p>

<b>CASSIO</b>

This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;<br>
For he was great of heart.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

[To IAGO]  O Spartan dog,<br>
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!<br>
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;<br>
This is thy work: the object poisons sight;<br>
Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,<br>
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,<br>
For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,<br>
Remains the censure of this hellish villain;<br>
The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!<br>
Myself will straight aboard: and to the state<br>
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
