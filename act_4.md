<h3>ACT IV</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the castle.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter OTHELLO and IAGO</i>

<b>IAGO</b>

Will you think so?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Think so, Iago!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What,<br>
To kiss in private?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

An unauthorized kiss.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Or to be naked with her friend in bed<br>
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!<br>
It is hypocrisy against the devil:<br>
They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,<br>
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:<br>
But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What then?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,<br>
She may, I think, bestow't on any man.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

She is protectress of her honour too:<br>
May she give that?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Her honour is an essence that's not seen;<br>
They have it very oft that have it not:<br>
But, for the handkerchief,--<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.<br>
Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,<br>
As doth the raven o'er the infected house,<br>
Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Ay, what of that?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  That's not so good now.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What,<br>
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?<br>
Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,<br>
Who having, by their own importunate suit,<br>
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,<br>
Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose<br>
But they must blab--<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Hath he said any thing?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,<br>
No more than he'll unswear.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What hath he said?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What? what?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Lie--<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

    With her?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

With her, on her; what you will.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when<br>
they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.<br>
--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To<br>
confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be<br>
hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.<br>
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing<br>
passion without some instruction. It is not words<br>
that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.<br>
--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--<br>
<p><i>Falls in a trance</i></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

Work on,<br>
My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;<br>
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,<br>
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!<br>
My lord, I say! Othello!<br>
<p><i>Enter CASSIO</i></p>
How now, Cassio!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

What's the matter?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:<br>
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Rub him about the temples.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

No, forbear;<br>
The lethargy must have his quiet course:<br>
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by<br>
Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:<br>
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,<br>
He will recover straight: when he is gone,<br>
I would on great occasion speak with you.<br>
<p><i>Exit CASSIO</i></p>
How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Dost thou mock me?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

                  I mock you! no, by heaven.<br>
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

A horned man's a monster and a beast.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

There's many a beast then in a populous city,<br>
And many a civil monster.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Did he confess it?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

                  Good sir, be a man;<br>
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked<br>
May draw with you: there's millions now alive<br>
That nightly lie in those unproper beds<br>
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.<br>
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,<br>
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,<br>
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;<br>
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Stand you awhile apart;<br>
Confine yourself but in a patient list.<br>
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--<br>
A passion most unsuiting such a man--<br>
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,<br>
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,<br>
Bade him anon return and here speak with me;<br>
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,<br>
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,<br>
That dwell in every region of his face;<br>
For I will make him tell the tale anew,<br>
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when<br>
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:<br>
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;<br>
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,<br>
And nothing of a man.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Dost thou hear, Iago?<br>
I will be found most cunning in my patience;<br>
But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

That's not amiss;<br>
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?<br>
<p><i>OTHELLO retires</i></p>
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,<br>
A housewife that by selling her desires<br>
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature<br>
That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague<br>
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:<br>
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain<br>
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:<br>
<p><i>Re-enter CASSIO</i></p>
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;<br>
And his unbookish jealousy must construe<br>
Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,<br>
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

The worser that you give me the addition<br>
Whose want even kills me.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.<br>
<p><i>Speaking lower</i></p>
Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,<br>
How quickly should you speed!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Alas, poor caitiff!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Look, how he laughs already!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I never knew woman love man so.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Do you hear, Cassio?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Now he importunes him<br>
To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

She gives it out that you shall marry hey:<br>
Do you intend it?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Ha, ha, ha!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some<br>
charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.<br>
Ha, ha, ha!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Prithee, say true.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I am a very villain else.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Have you scored me? Well.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

This is the monkey's own giving out: she is<br>
persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and<br>
flattery, not out of my promise.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.<br>
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with<br>
certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,<br>
and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture<br>
imports it.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,<br>
and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,<br>
I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall<br>
throw it to.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Well, I must leave her company.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Before me! look, where she comes.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.<br>
<p><i>Enter BIANCA</i></p>
What do you mean by this haunting of me?<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you<br>
mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?<br>
I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the<br>
work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find<br>
it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!<br>
This is some minx's token, and I must take out the<br>
work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever<br>
you had it, I'll take out no work on't.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you<br>
will not, come when you are next prepared for.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

After her, after her.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Will you sup there?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

'Faith, I intend so.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain<br>
speak with you.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Prithee, come; will you?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Go to; say no more.<br>
<p><i>Exit CASSIO</i></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

[Advancing]  How shall I murder him, Iago?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O Iago!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

And did you see the handkerchief?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Was that mine?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the<br>
foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he<br>
hath given it his whore.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I would have him nine years a-killing.<br>
A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Nay, you must forget that.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;<br>
for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to<br>
stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the<br>
world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by<br>
an emperor's side and command him tasks.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Nay, that's not your way.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate<br>
with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she<br>
will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high<br>
and plenteous wit and invention:--<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

She's the worse for all this.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so<br>
gentle a condition!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Ay, too gentle.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!<br>
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her<br>
patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes<br>
near nobody.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

O, 'tis foul in her.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

With mine officer!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

That's fouler.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not<br>
expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty<br>
unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even<br>
the bed she hath contaminated.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you<br>
shall hear more by midnight.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Excellent good.<br>
<p><i>A trumpet within</i></p>
What trumpet is that same?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico<br>
Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.<br>
<p><i>Enter LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants</i></p>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Save you, worthy general!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

With all my heart, sir.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

The duke and senators of Venice greet you.<br>
<p><i>Gives him a letter</i></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.<br>
<p><i>Opens the letter, and reads</i></p>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I am very glad to see you, signior<br>
Welcome to Cyprus.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Lives, sir.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord<br>
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Are you sure of that?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

My lord?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

[Reads]  'This fail you not to do, as you will--'<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

He did not call; he's busy in the paper.<br>
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

A most unhappy one: I would do much<br>
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Fire and brimstone!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

My lord?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

       Are you wise?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

What, is he angry?<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

                  May be the letter moved him;<br>
For, as I think, they do command him home,<br>
Deputing Cassio in his government.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Trust me, I am glad on't.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Indeed!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

My lord?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I am glad to see you mad.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Why, sweet Othello,--<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

[Striking her]  Devil!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I have not deserved this.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,<br>
Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:<br>
Make her amends; she weeps.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O devil, devil!<br>
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,<br>
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.<br>
Out of my sight!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I will not stay to offend you.<br>
<p><i>Going</i></p>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Truly, an obedient lady:<br>
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Mistress!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

        My lord?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What would you with her, sir?<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Who, I, my lord?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:<br>
Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,<br>
And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;<br>
And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,<br>
Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.<br>
Concerning this, sir,--O  well-painted passion!--<br>
I am commanded home. Get you away;<br>
I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,<br>
And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!<br>
<p><i>Exit DESDEMONA</i></p>
Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,<br>
I do entreat that we may sup together:<br>
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!<br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate<br>
Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature<br>
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue<br>
The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,<br>
Could neither graze nor pierce?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

He is much changed.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure<br>
What he might be: if what he might he is not,<br>
I would to heaven he were!<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

What, strike his wife!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew<br>
That stroke would prove the worst!<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Is it his use?<br>
Or did the letters work upon his blood,<br>
And new-create this fault?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Alas, alas!<br>
It is not honesty in me to speak<br>
What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,<br>
And his own courses will denote him so<br>
That I may save my speech: do but go after,<br>
And mark how he continues.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

I am sorry that I am deceived in him.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
<h3>SCENE II. A room in the castle.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA</i>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

You have seen nothing then?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

But then I saw no harm, and then I heard<br>
Each syllable that breath made up between them.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What, did they never whisper?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Never, my lord.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Nor send you out o' the way?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Never.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Never, my lord.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

That's strange.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,<br>
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,<br>
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.<br>
If any wretch have put this in your head,<br>
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!<br>
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,<br>
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives<br>
Is foul as slander.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Bid her come hither: go.<br>
<p><i>Exit EMILIA</i></p>
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd<br>
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,<br>
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets<br>
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.<br>
<p><i>Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA</i></p>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

My lord, what is your will?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Pray, chuck, come hither.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

What is your pleasure?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Let me see your eyes;<br>
Look in my face.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

                  What horrible fancy's this?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

[To EMILIA]  Some of your function, mistress;<br>
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;<br>
Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:<br>
Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.<br>
<p><i>Exit EMILIA</i></p>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?<br>
I understand a fury in your words.<br>
But not the words.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Why, what art thou?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Your wife, my lord; your true<br>
And loyal wife.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Come, swear it, damn thyself<br>
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves<br>
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:<br>
Swear thou art honest.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Heaven doth truly know it.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O Desdemona! away! away! away!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?<br>
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?<br>
If haply you my father do suspect<br>
An instrument of this your calling back,<br>
Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,<br>
Why, I have lost him too.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Had it pleased heaven<br>
To try me with affliction; had they rain'd<br>
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.<br>
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,<br>
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,<br>
I should have found in some place of my soul<br>
A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me<br>
A fixed figure for the time of scorn<br>
To point his slow unmoving finger at!<br>
Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:<br>
But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,<br>
Where either I must live, or bear no life;<br>
The fountain from the which my current runs,<br>
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!<br>
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads<br>
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,<br>
Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--<br>
Ay, there, look grim as hell!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,<br>
That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,<br>
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet<br>
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst<br>
ne'er been born!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,<br>
Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!<br>
Committed! O thou public commoner!<br>
I should make very forges of my cheeks,<br>
That would to cinders burn up modesty,<br>
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!<br>
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,<br>
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets<br>
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,<br>
And will not hear it. What committed!<br>
Impudent strumpet!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

                  By heaven, you do me wrong.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Are you not a strumpet?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

No, as I am a Christian:<br>
If to preserve this vessel for my lord<br>
From any other foul unlawful touch<br>
Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What, not a whore?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

                  No, as I shall be saved.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Is't possible?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

                  O, heaven forgive us!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I cry you mercy, then:<br>
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice<br>
That married with Othello.<br>
<p><i>Raising his voice</i></p>
You, mistress,<br>
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,<br>
And keep the gate of hell!<br>
<p><i>Re-enter EMILIA</i></p>
You, you, ay, you!<br>
We have done our course; there's money for your pains:<br>
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?<br>
How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

'Faith, half asleep.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

With who?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Why, with my lord, madam.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Who is thy lord?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

                  He that is yours, sweet lady.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;<br>
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,<br>
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight<br>
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;<br>
And call thy husband hither.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Here's a change indeed!<br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.<br>
How have I been behaved, that he might stick<br>
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?<br>
<p><i>Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO</i></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

What is your pleasure, madam?<br>
How is't with you?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes<br>
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:<br>
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,<br>
I am a child to chiding.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What's the matter, lady?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.<br>
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,<br>
As true hearts cannot bear.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Am I that name, Iago?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What name, fair lady?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Such as she says my lord did say I was.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink<br>
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Why did he so?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I do not know; I am sure I am none such.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Hath she forsook so many noble matches,<br>
Her father and her country and her friends,<br>
To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

It is my wretched fortune.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Beshrew him for't!<br>
How comes this trick upon him?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Nay, heaven doth know.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,<br>
Some busy and insinuating rogue,<br>
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,<br>
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

If any such there be, heaven pardon him!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!<br>
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?<br>
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?<br>
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,<br>
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.<br>
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,<br>
And put in every honest hand a whip<br>
To lash the rascals naked through the world<br>
Even from the east to the west!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Speak within door.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was<br>
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,<br>
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

You are a fool; go to.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

O good Iago,<br>
What shall I do to win my lord again?<br>
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,<br>
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:<br>
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,<br>
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,<br>
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,<br>
Delighted them in any other form;<br>
Or that I do not yet, and ever did.<br>
And ever will--though he do shake me off<br>
To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,<br>
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;<br>
And his unkindness may defeat my life,<br>
But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'<br>
It does abhor me now I speak the word;<br>
To do the act that might the addition earn<br>
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:<br>
The business of the state does him offence,<br>
And he does chide with you.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

If 'twere no other--<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

'Tis but so, I warrant.<br>
<p><i>Trumpets within</i></p>
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!<br>
The messengers of Venice stay the meat;<br>
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA</i></p>
<p><i>Enter RODERIGO</i></p>
How now, Roderigo!<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What in the contrary?<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;<br>
and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me<br>
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least<br>
advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure<br>
it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what<br>
already I have foolishly suffered.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Will you hear me, Roderigo?<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and<br>
performances are no kin together.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

You charge me most unjustly.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of<br>
my means. The jewels you have had from me to<br>
deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a<br>
votarist: you have told me she hath received them<br>
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden<br>
respect and acquaintance, but I find none.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Well; go to; very well.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis<br>
not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin<br>
to find myself fobbed in it.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Very well.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself<br>
known to Desdemona: if she will return me my<br>
jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my<br>
unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I<br>
will seek satisfaction of you.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

You have said now.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from<br>
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than<br>
ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast<br>
taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I<br>
protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

It hath not appeared.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your<br>
suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,<br>
Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I<br>
have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean<br>
purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if<br>
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,<br>
take me from this world with treachery and devise<br>
engines for my life.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice<br>
to depute Cassio in Othello's place.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona<br>
return again to Venice.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with<br>
him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be<br>
lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be<br>
so determinate as the removing of Cassio.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

How do you mean, removing of him?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;<br>
knocking out his brains.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

And that you would have me to do?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.<br>
He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I<br>
go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable<br>
fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which<br>
I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,<br>
you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near<br>
to second your attempt, and he shall fall between<br>
us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with<br>
me; I will show you such a necessity in his death<br>
that you shall think yourself bound to put it on<br>
him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows<br>
to waste: about it.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

I will hear further reason for this.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

And you shall be satisfied.<br>

<h3>SCENE III. Another room In the castle.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA and Attendants</i>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.<br>

<b>LODOVICO</b>

Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Your honour is most welcome.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Will you walk, sir?<br>
O,--Desdemona,--<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

My lord?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned<br>
forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I will, my lord.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and Attendants</i></p>

<b>EMILIA</b>

How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

He says he will return incontinent:<br>
He hath commanded me to go to bed,<br>
And bade me to dismiss you.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Dismiss me!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.<br>
Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:<br>
We must not now displease him.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

I would you had never seen him!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

So would not I	my love doth so approve him,<br>
That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--<br>
Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!<br>
If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me<br>
In one of those same sheets.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Come, come you talk.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:<br>
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad<br>
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'<br>
An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,<br>
And she died singing it: that song to-night<br>
Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,<br>
But to go hang my head all at one side,<br>
And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Shall I go fetch your night-gown?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

No, unpin me here.<br>
This Lodovico is a proper man.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

A very handsome man.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

He speaks well.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot<br>
to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

[Singing]  The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,<br>
Sing all a green willow:<br>
Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,<br>
Sing willow, willow, willow:<br>
The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;<br>
Sing willow, willow, willow;<br>
Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;<br>
Lay by these:--<br>
<p><i>Singing</i></p>
Sing willow, willow, willow;<br>
Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--<br>
<p><i>Singing</i></p>
Sing all a green willow must be my garland.<br>
Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-<br>
Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

It's the wind.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

[Singing]  I call'd my love false love; but what<br>
said he then?<br>
Sing willow, willow, willow:<br>
If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!<br>
So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;<br>
Doth that bode weeping?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

'Tis neither here nor there.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!<br>
Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--<br>
That there be women do abuse their husbands<br>
In such gross kind?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

There be some such, no question.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Why, would not you?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

No, by this heavenly light!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Nor I neither by this heavenly light;<br>
I might do't as well i' the dark.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.<br>
For a small vice.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

In troth, I think thou wouldst not.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had<br>
done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a<br>
joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for<br>
gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty<br>
exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would<br>
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a<br>
monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong<br>
For the whole world.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and<br>
having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your<br>
own world, and you might quickly make it right.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I do not think there is any such woman.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would<br>
store the world they played for.<br>
But I do think it is their husbands' faults<br>
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,<br>
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,<br>
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,<br>
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,<br>
Or scant our former having in despite;<br>
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,<br>
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know<br>
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell<br>
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,<br>
As husbands have. What is it that they do<br>
When they change us for others? Is it sport?<br>
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?<br>
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?<br>
It is so too: and have not we affections,<br>
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?<br>
Then let them use us well: else let them know,<br>
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,<br>
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
