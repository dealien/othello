<p></p><div>
<i>Enter OTHELLO and IAGO</i>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.1">Will you think so?</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.2">                  Think so, Iago!</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.3">What,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.4">To kiss in private?</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.5">An unauthorized kiss.</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.6">Or to be naked with her friend in bed</span><br>
<span name="4.1.7">An hour or more, not meaning any harm?</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.8">Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!</span><br>
<span name="4.1.9">It is hypocrisy against the devil:</span><br>
<span name="4.1.10">They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.11">The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.12">So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:</span><br>
<span name="4.1.13">But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.14">What then?</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.15">Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.16">She may, I think, bestow't on any man.</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.17">She is protectress of her honour too:</span><br>
<span name="4.1.18">May she give that?</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.19">Her honour is an essence that's not seen;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.20">They have it very oft that have it not:</span><br>
<span name="4.1.21">But, for the handkerchief,--</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.22">By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.</span><br>
<span name="4.1.23">Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.24">As doth the raven o'er the infected house,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.25">Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.26">Ay, what of that?</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.27">                  That's not so good now.</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.28">What,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.29">If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?</span><br>
<span name="4.1.30">Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.31">Who having, by their own importunate suit,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.32">Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.33">Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose</span><br>
<span name="4.1.34">But they must blab--</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.35">Hath he said any thing?</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.36">He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.37">No more than he'll unswear.</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.38">What hath he said?</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.39">'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.40">What? what?</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.41">Lie--</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.42">    With her?</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.43">With her, on her; what you will.</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.44">Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when</span><br>
<span name="4.1.45">they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.</span><br>
<span name="4.1.46">--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To</span><br>
<span name="4.1.47">confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be</span><br>
<span name="4.1.48">hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.</span><br>
<span name="4.1.49">Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing</span><br>
<span name="4.1.50">passion without some instruction. It is not words</span><br>
<span name="4.1.51">that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.</span><br>
<span name="4.1.52">--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--</span><br>
<p><i>Falls in a trance</i></p>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.53">Work on,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.54">My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.55">And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.56">All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!</span><br>
<span name="4.1.57">My lord, I say! Othello!</span><br>
<p><i>Enter CASSIO</i></p>
<span name="4.1.58">How now, Cassio!</span><br>
</div>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.59">What's the matter?</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.60">My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:</span><br>
<span name="4.1.61">This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.</span><br>
</div>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.62">Rub him about the temples.</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.63">No, forbear;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.64">The lethargy must have his quiet course:</span><br>
<span name="4.1.65">If not, he foams at mouth and by and by</span><br>
<span name="4.1.66">Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:</span><br>
<span name="4.1.67">Do you withdraw yourself a little while,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.68">He will recover straight: when he is gone,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.69">I would on great occasion speak with you.</span><br>
<p><i>Exit CASSIO</i></p>
<span name="4.1.70">How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.71">Dost thou mock me?</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.72">                  I mock you! no, by heaven.</span><br>
<span name="4.1.73">Would you would bear your fortune like a man!</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.74">A horned man's a monster and a beast.</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.75">There's many a beast then in a populous city,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.76">And many a civil monster.</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.77">Did he confess it?</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.78">                  Good sir, be a man;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.79">Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked</span><br>
<span name="4.1.80">May draw with you: there's millions now alive</span><br>
<span name="4.1.81">That nightly lie in those unproper beds</span><br>
<span name="4.1.82">Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.</span><br>
<span name="4.1.83">O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.84">To lip a wanton in a secure couch,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.85">And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.86">And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.87">O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.88">Stand you awhile apart;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.89">Confine yourself but in a patient list.</span><br>
<span name="4.1.90">Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--</span><br>
<span name="4.1.91">A passion most unsuiting such a man--</span><br>
<span name="4.1.92">Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.93">And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.94">Bade him anon return and here speak with me;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.95">The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.96">And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.97">That dwell in every region of his face;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.98">For I will make him tell the tale anew,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.99">Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when</span><br>
<span name="4.1.100">He hath, and is again to cope your wife:</span><br>
<span name="4.1.101">I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.102">Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.103">And nothing of a man.</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.104">Dost thou hear, Iago?</span><br>
<span name="4.1.105">I will be found most cunning in my patience;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.106">But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.107">That's not amiss;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.108">But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?</span><br>
<p><i>OTHELLO retires</i></p>
<span name="4.1.109">Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.110">A housewife that by selling her desires</span><br>
<span name="4.1.111">Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature</span><br>
<span name="4.1.112">That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague</span><br>
<span name="4.1.113">To beguile many and be beguiled by one:</span><br>
<span name="4.1.114">He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain</span><br>
<span name="4.1.115">From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:</span><br>
<p><i>Re-enter CASSIO</i></p>
<span name="4.1.116">As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;</span><br>
<span name="4.1.117">And his unbookish jealousy must construe</span><br>
<span name="4.1.118">Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.119">Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?</span><br>
</div>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.120">The worser that you give me the addition</span><br>
<span name="4.1.121">Whose want even kills me.</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.122">Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.</span><br>
<p><i>Speaking lower</i></p>
<span name="4.1.123">Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,</span><br>
<span name="4.1.124">How quickly should you speed!</span><br>
</div>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.125">Alas, poor caitiff!</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.126">Look, how he laughs already!</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.127">I never knew woman love man so.</span><br>
</div>

<b>CASSIO</b>

<span name="4.1.128">Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.129">Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.130">Do you hear, Cassio?</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.131">Now he importunes him</span><br>
<span name="4.1.132">To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.</span><br>
</div>

<b>IAGO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.133">She gives it out that you shall marry hey:</span><br>

<div>
<span name="4.1.135">Ha, ha, ha!</span><br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<div>

<span name="4.1.139">Ha, ha, ha!</span><br>
</div>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.140">So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.</span><br>

</div>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.145">This is the monkey's own giving out: she is</span><br>
<span name="4.1.146">persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and</span><br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<div>

</div>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<div>
<span name="4.1.149">She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.</span><br>
<span name="4.1.150">I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with</span><br>

<span name="4.3.81">gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty</span><br>

<span name="4.3.83">not make her husband a cuckold to make him a</span><br>

<span name="4.3.86">For the whole world.</span><br>

<div>
<span name="4.3.87">Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and</span><br>

<span name="4.3.92">store the world they played for.</span><br>
<span name="4.3.93">But I do think it is their husbands' faults</span><br>
<span name="4.3.94">If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,</span><br>
<span name="4.3.95">And pour our treasures into foreign laps,</span><br>
<span name="4.3.96">Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</span><br>
<span name="4.3.97">Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,</span><br>
<span name="4.3.98">Or scant our former having in despite;</span><br>
<span name="4.3.99">Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,</span><br>
<span name="4.3.100">Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</span><br>
<span name="4.3.101">Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell</span><br>
<span name="4.3.102">And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</span><br>
<span name="4.3.103">As husbands have. What is it that they do</span><br>
<span name="4.3.104">When they change us for others? Is it sport?</span><br>
<span name="4.3.105">I think it is: and doth affection breed it?</span><br>
<span name="4.3.106">I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?</span><br>
<span name="4.3.107">It is so too: and have not we affections,</span><br>
<span name="4.3.108">Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</span><br>
<span name="4.3.109">Then let them use us well: else let them know,</span><br>
<span name="4.3.110">The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</span><br>
