<h3>ACT III</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. Before the castle.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter CASSIO and some Musicians</i><br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Masters, play here; I will content your pains;<br>
Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'<br>
<p><i>Music</i><br></p>
<p><i>Enter Clown</i><br></p>

<b>Clown</b>

Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,<br>
that they speak i' the nose thus?<br>

<b>First Musician</b>

How, sir, how!<br>

<b>Clown</b>

Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?<br>

<b>First Musician</b>

Ay, marry, are they, sir.<br>

<b>Clown</b>

O, thereby hangs a tail.<br>

<b>First Musician</b>

Whereby hangs a tale, sir?<br>

<b>Clown</b>

Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.<br>
But, masters, here's money for you: and the general<br>
so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's<br>
sake, to make no more noise with it.<br>

<b>First Musician</b>

Well, sir, we will not.<br>

<b>Clown</b>

If you have any music that may not be heard, to't<br>
again: but, as they say to hear music the general<br>
does not greatly care.<br>

<b>First Musician</b>

We have none such, sir.<br>

<b>Clown</b>

Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:<br>
go; vanish into air; away!<br>
<p><i>Exeunt Musicians</i><br></p>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Dost thou hear, my honest friend?<br>

<b>Clown</b>

No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece<br>
of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends<br>
the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's<br>
one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:<br>
wilt thou do this?<br>

<b>Clown</b>

She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I<br>
shall seem to notify unto her.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Do, good my friend.<br>
<p><i>Exit Clown</i><br></p>
<p><i>Enter IAGO</i><br></p>
In happy time, Iago.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

You have not been a-bed, then?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Why, no; the day had broke<br>
Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,<br>
To send in to your wife: my suit to her<br>
Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona<br>
Procure me some access.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I'll send her to you presently;<br>
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor<br>
Out of the way, that your converse and business<br>
May be more free.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I humbly thank you for't.<br>
<p><i>Exit IAGO</i><br></p>
I never knew<br>
A Florentine more kind and honest.<br>
<p><i>Enter EMILIA</i><br></p>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry<br>
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.<br>
The general and his wife are talking of it;<br>
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,<br>
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,<br>
And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom<br>
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you<br>
And needs no other suitor but his likings<br>
To take the safest occasion by the front<br>
To bring you in again.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Yet, I beseech you,<br>
If you think fit, or that it may be done,<br>
Give me advantage of some brief discourse<br>
With Desdemona alone.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Pray you, come in;<br>
I will bestow you where you shall have time<br>
To speak your bosom freely.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I am much bound to you.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i><br></p>
<h3>SCENE II. A room in the castle.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen</i><br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;<br>
And by him do my duties to the senate:<br>
That done, I will be walking on the works;<br>
Repair there to me.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Well, my good lord, I'll do't.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?<br>

<b>Gentleman</b>

We'll wait upon your lordship.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i><br></p>
<h3>SCENE III. The garden of the castle.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA</i><br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do<br>
All my abilities in thy behalf.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,<br>
As if the case were his.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,<br>
But I will have my lord and you again<br>
As friendly as you were.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Bounteous madam,<br>
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,<br>
He's never any thing but your true servant.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:<br>
You have known him long; and be you well assured<br>
He shall in strangeness stand no further off<br>
Than in a polite distance.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Ay, but, lady,<br>
That policy may either last so long,<br>
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,<br>
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,<br>
That, I being absent and my place supplied,<br>
My general will forget my love and service.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Do not doubt that; before Emilia here<br>
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,<br>
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it<br>
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;<br>
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;<br>
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;<br>
I'll intermingle every thing he does<br>
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;<br>
For thy solicitor shall rather die<br>
Than give thy cause away.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Madam, here comes my lord.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Madam, I'll take my leave.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Why, stay, and hear me speak.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,<br>
Unfit for mine own purposes.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Well, do your discretion.<br>
<p><i>Exit CASSIO</i><br></p>
<p><i>Enter OTHELLO and IAGO</i><br></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

Ha! I like not that.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What dost thou say?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,<br>
That he would steal away so guilty-like,<br>
Seeing you coming.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  I do believe 'twas he.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

How now, my lord!<br>
I have been talking with a suitor here,<br>
A man that languishes in your displeasure.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Who is't you mean?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,<br>
If I have any grace or power to move you,<br>
His present reconciliation take;<br>
For if he be not one that truly loves you,<br>
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,<br>
I have no judgment in an honest face:<br>
I prithee, call him back.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Went he hence now?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Ay, sooth; so humbled<br>
That he hath left part of his grief with me,<br>
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

But shall't be shortly?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

The sooner, sweet, for you.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Shall't be to-night at supper?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

No, not to-night.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

To-morrow dinner, then?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I shall not dine at home;<br>
I meet the captains at the citadel.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;<br>
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:<br>
I prithee, name the time, but let it not<br>
Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;<br>
And yet his trespass, in our common reason--<br>
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples<br>
Out of their best--is not almost a fault<br>
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?<br>
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,<br>
What you would ask me, that I should deny,<br>
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,<br>
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,<br>
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,<br>
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do<br>
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;<br>
I will deny thee nothing.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Why, this is not a boon;<br>
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,<br>
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,<br>
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit<br>
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit<br>
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,<br>
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight<br>
And fearful to be granted.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I will deny thee nothing:<br>
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,<br>
To leave me but a little to myself.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;<br>
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA</i><br></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,<br>
But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,<br>
Chaos is come again.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

My noble lord--<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  What dost thou say, Iago?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,<br>
Know of your love?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

But for a satisfaction of my thought;<br>
No further harm.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Why of thy thought, Iago?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I did not think he had been acquainted with her.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O, yes; and went between us very oft.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Indeed!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?<br>
Is he not honest?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Honest, my lord!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Honest! ay, honest.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

My lord, for aught I know.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What dost thou think?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Think, my lord!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Think, my lord!<br>
By heaven, he echoes me,<br>
As if there were some monster in his thought<br>
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:<br>
I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,<br>
When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?<br>
And when I told thee he was of my counsel<br>
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'<br>
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,<br>
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain<br>
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,<br>
Show me thy thought.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

My lord, you know I love you.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I think thou dost;<br>
And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,<br>
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,<br>
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:<br>
For such things in a false disloyal knave<br>
Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just<br>
They are close delations, working from the heart<br>
That passion cannot rule.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

For Michael Cassio,<br>
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I think so too.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

                  Men should be what they seem;<br>
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Certain, men should be what they seem.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Nay, yet there's more in this:<br>
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,<br>
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts<br>
The worst of words.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Good my lord, pardon me:<br>
Though I am bound to every act of duty,<br>
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.<br>
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;<br>
As where's that palace whereinto foul things<br>
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,<br>
But some uncleanly apprehensions<br>
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit<br>
With meditations lawful?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,<br>
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear<br>
A stranger to thy thoughts.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I do beseech you--<br>
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,<br>
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague<br>
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy<br>
Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,<br>
From one that so imperfectly conceits,<br>
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble<br>
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.<br>
It were not for your quiet nor your good,<br>
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,<br>
To let you know my thoughts.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What dost thou mean?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,<br>
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:<br>
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;<br>
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:<br>
But he that filches from me my good name<br>
Robs me of that which not enriches him<br>
And makes me poor indeed.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;<br>
Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ha!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;<br>
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock<br>
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss<br>
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;<br>
But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er<br>
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O misery!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Poor and content is rich and rich enough,<br>
But riches fineless is as poor as winter<br>
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.<br>
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend<br>
From jealousy!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Why, why is this?<br>
Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,<br>
To follow still the changes of the moon<br>
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt<br>
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,<br>
When I shall turn the business of my soul<br>
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,<br>
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous<br>
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,<br>
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;<br>
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:<br>
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw<br>
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;<br>
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;<br>
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;<br>
And on the proof, there is no more but this,--<br>
Away at once with love or jealousy!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason<br>
To show the love and duty that I bear you<br>
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,<br>
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.<br>
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;<br>
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:<br>
I would not have your free and noble nature,<br>
Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:<br>
I know our country disposition well;<br>
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks<br>
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience<br>
Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Dost thou say so?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

She did deceive her father, marrying you;<br>
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,<br>
She loved them most.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

And so she did.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Why, go to then;<br>
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,<br>
To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-<br>
He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;<br>
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon<br>
For too much loving you.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I am bound to thee for ever.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Not a jot, not a jot.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I' faith, I fear it has.<br>
I hope you will consider what is spoke<br>
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:<br>
I am to pray you not to strain my speech<br>
To grosser issues nor to larger reach<br>
Than to suspicion.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I will not.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

          Should you do so, my lord,<br>
My speech should fall into such vile success<br>
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--<br>
My lord, I see you're moved.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

No, not much moved:<br>
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Long live she so! and long live you to think so!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

And yet, how nature erring from itself,--<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--<br>
Not to affect many proposed matches<br>
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,<br>
Whereto we see in all things nature tends--<br>
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,<br>
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.<br>
But pardon me; I do not in position<br>
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear<br>
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,<br>
May fall to match you with her country forms<br>
And happily repent.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Farewell, farewell:<br>
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;<br>
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

[Going]  My lord, I take my leave.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless<br>
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

[Returning]  My lord, I would I might entreat<br>
your honour<br>
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:<br>
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,<br>
For sure, he fills it up with great ability,<br>
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,<br>
You shall by that perceive him and his means:<br>
Note, if your lady strain his entertainment<br>
With any strong or vehement importunity;<br>
Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,<br>
Let me be thought too busy in my fears--<br>
As worthy cause I have to fear I am--<br>
And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Fear not my government.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I once more take my leave.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

This fellow's of exceeding honesty,<br>
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,<br>
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,<br>
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,<br>
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,<br>
To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black<br>
And have not those soft parts of conversation<br>
That chamberers have, or for I am declined<br>
Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--<br>
She's gone. I am abused; and my relief<br>
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,<br>
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,<br>
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,<br>
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,<br>
Than keep a corner in the thing I love<br>
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;<br>
Prerogatived are they less than the base;<br>
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:<br>
Even then this forked plague is fated to us<br>
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:<br>
<p><i>Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA</i><br></p>
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!<br>
I'll not believe't.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

How now, my dear Othello!<br>
Your dinner, and the generous islanders<br>
By you invited, do attend your presence.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I am to blame.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

                  Why do you speak so faintly?<br>
Are you not well?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I have a pain upon my forehead here.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:<br>
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour<br>
It will be well.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Your napkin is too little:<br>
<p><i>He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops</i><br></p>
Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I am very sorry that you are not well.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA</i><br></p>

<b>EMILIA</b>

I am glad I have found this napkin:<br>
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:<br>
My wayward husband hath a hundred times<br>
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,<br>
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,<br>
That she reserves it evermore about her<br>
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,<br>
And give't Iago: what he will do with it<br>
Heaven knows, not I;<br>
I nothing but to please his fantasy.<br>
<p><i>Re-enter Iago</i><br></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

How now! what do you here alone?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

A thing for me? it is a common thing--<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Ha!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

To have a foolish wife.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

O, is that all? What will you give me now<br>
For the same handkerchief?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What handkerchief?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

What handkerchief?<br>
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;<br>
That which so often you did bid me steal.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Hast stol'n it from her?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.<br>
And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.<br>
Look, here it is.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

                  A good wench; give it me.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

What will you do with 't, that you have been<br>
so earnest<br>
To have me filch it?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

[Snatching it]  Why, what's that to you?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

If it be not for some purpose of import,<br>
Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad<br>
When she shall lack it.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.<br>
Go, leave me.<br>
<p><i>Exit EMILIA</i><br></p>
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,<br>
And let him find it. Trifles light as air<br>
Are to the jealous confirmations strong<br>
As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.<br>
The Moor already changes with my poison:<br>
Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.<br>
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,<br>
But with a little act upon the blood.<br>
Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:<br>
Look, where he comes!<br>
<p><i>Re-enter OTHELLO</i><br></p>
Not poppy, nor mandragora,<br>
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,<br>
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep<br>
Which thou owedst yesterday.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ha! ha! false to me?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Why, how now, general! no more of that.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:<br>
I swear 'tis better to be much abused<br>
Than but to know't a little.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

How now, my lord!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?<br>
I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:<br>
I slept the next night well, was free and merry;<br>
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:<br>
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,<br>
Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I am sorry to hear this.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I had been happy, if the general camp,<br>
Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,<br>
So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever<br>
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!<br>
Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,<br>
That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!<br>
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,<br>
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,<br>
The royal banner, and all quality,<br>
Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!<br>
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats<br>
The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,<br>
Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Is't possible, my lord?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,<br>
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:<br>
Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,<br>
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog<br>
Than answer my waked wrath!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Is't come to this?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,<br>
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop<br>
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

My noble lord,--<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

If thou dost slander her and torture me,<br>
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;<br>
On horror's head horrors accumulate;<br>
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;<br>
For nothing canst thou to damnation add<br>
Greater than that.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

                  O grace! O heaven forgive me!<br>
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?<br>
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.<br>
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!<br>
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,<br>
To be direct and honest is not safe.<br>
I thank you for this profit; and from hence<br>
I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I should be wise, for honesty's a fool<br>
And loses that it works for.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

By the world,<br>
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;<br>
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.<br>
I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh<br>
As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black<br>
As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,<br>
Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,<br>
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:<br>
I do repent me that I put it to you.<br>
You would be satisfied?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Would! nay, I will.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?<br>
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--<br>
Behold her topp'd?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Death and damnation! O!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

It were a tedious difficulty, I think,<br>
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,<br>
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster<br>
More than their own! What then? how then?<br>
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?<br>
It is impossible you should see this,<br>
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,<br>
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross<br>
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,<br>
If imputation and strong circumstances,<br>
Which lead directly to the door of truth,<br>
Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Give me a living reason she's disloyal.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I do not like the office:<br>
But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,<br>
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,<br>
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;<br>
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,<br>
I could not sleep.<br>
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,<br>
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:<br>
One of this kind is Cassio:<br>
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,<br>
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'<br>
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,<br>
Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,<br>
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots<br>
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg<br>
Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then<br>
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O monstrous! monstrous!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Nay, this was but his dream.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

But this denoted a foregone conclusion:<br>
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

And this may help to thicken other proofs<br>
That do demonstrate thinly.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I'll tear her all to pieces.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;<br>
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,<br>
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief<br>
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I know not that; but such a handkerchief--<br>
I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day<br>
See Cassio wipe his beard with.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

If it be that--<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

If it be that, or any that was hers,<br>
It speaks against her with the other proofs.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!<br>
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.<br>
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;<br>
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.<br>
'Tis gone.<br>
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!<br>
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne<br>
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,<br>
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Yet be content.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O, blood, blood, blood!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,<br>
Whose icy current and compulsive course<br>
Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on<br>
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,<br>
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,<br>
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,<br>
Till that a capable and wide revenge<br>
Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,<br>
<p><i>Kneels</i><br></p>
In the due reverence of a sacred vow<br>
I here engage my words.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Do not rise yet.<br>
<p><i>Kneels</i><br></p>
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,<br>
You elements that clip us round about,<br>
Witness that here Iago doth give up<br>
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,<br>
To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,<br>
And to obey shall be in me remorse,<br>
What bloody business ever.<br>
<p><i>They rise</i><br></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I greet thy love,<br>
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,<br>
And will upon the instant put thee to't:<br>
Within these three days let me hear thee say<br>
That Cassio's not alive.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:<br>
But let her live.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!<br>
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,<br>
To furnish me with some swift means of death<br>
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I am your own for ever.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i><br></p>
<h3>SCENE IV. Before the castle.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown</i><br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?<br>

<b>Clown</b>

I dare not say he lies any where.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Why, man?<br>

<b>Clown</b>

He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,<br>
is stabbing.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Go to: where lodges he?<br>

<b>Clown</b>

To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Can any thing be made of this?<br>

<b>Clown</b>

I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a<br>
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were<br>
to lie in mine own throat.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?<br>

<b>Clown</b>

I will catechise the world for him; that is, make<br>
questions, and by them answer.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have<br>
moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.<br>

<b>Clown</b>

To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and<br>
therefore I will attempt the doing it.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

I know not, madam.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse<br>
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor<br>
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness<br>
As jealous creatures are, it were enough<br>
To put him to ill thinking.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Is he not jealous?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Who, he? I think the sun where he was born<br>
Drew all such humours from him.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Look, where he comes.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I will not leave him now till Cassio<br>
Be call'd to him.<br>
<p><i>Enter OTHELLO</i><br></p>
How is't with you, my lord<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Well, my good lady.<br>
<p><i>Aside</i><br></p>
O, hardness to dissemble!--<br>
How do you, Desdemona?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Well, my good lord.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:<br>
Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires<br>
A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,<br>
Much castigation, exercise devout;<br>
For here's a young and sweating devil here,<br>
That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,<br>
A frank one.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

                  You may, indeed, say so;<br>
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;<br>
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What promise, chuck?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;<br>
Lend me thy handkerchief.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Here, my lord.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

That which I gave you.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I have it not about me.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Not?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

   No, indeed, my lord.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

That is a fault.<br>
That handkerchief<br>
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;<br>
She was a charmer, and could almost read<br>
The thoughts of people: she told her, while<br>
she kept it,<br>
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father<br>
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it<br>
Or made gift of it, my father's eye<br>
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt<br>
After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;<br>
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,<br>
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;<br>
Make it a darling like your precious eye;<br>
To lose't or give't away were such perdition<br>
As nothing else could match.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Is't possible?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:<br>
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world<br>
The sun to course two hundred compasses,<br>
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;<br>
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;<br>
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful<br>
Conserved of maidens' hearts.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Indeed! is't true?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Most veritable; therefore look to't well.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Then would to God that I had never seen't!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Ha! wherefore?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Why do you speak so startingly and rash?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out<br>
o' the way?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Heaven bless us!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Say you?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

It is not lost; but what an if it were?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

How!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I say, it is not lost.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Fetch't, let me see't.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.<br>
This is a trick to put me from my suit:<br>
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Come, come;<br>
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

The handkerchief!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

                  I pray, talk me of Cassio.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

The handkerchief!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

                  A man that all his time<br>
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,<br>
Shared dangers with you,--<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

The handkerchief!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

In sooth, you are to blame.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Away!<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Is not this man jealous?<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I ne'er saw this before.<br>
Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:<br>
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:<br>
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;<br>
To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,<br>
They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!<br>
<p><i>Enter CASSIO and IAGO</i><br></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:<br>
And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you<br>
That by your virtuous means I may again<br>
Exist, and be a member of his love<br>
Whom I with all the office of my heart<br>
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.<br>
If my offence be of such mortal kind<br>
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,<br>
Nor purposed merit in futurity,<br>
Can ransom me into his love again,<br>
But to know so must be my benefit;<br>
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,<br>
And shut myself up in some other course,<br>
To fortune's alms.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

                  Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!<br>
My advocation is not now in tune;<br>
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,<br>
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.<br>
So help me every spirit sanctified,<br>
As I have spoken for you all my best<br>
And stood within the blank of his displeasure<br>
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:<br>
What I can do I will; and more I will<br>
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Is my lord angry?<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

                  He went hence but now,<br>
And certainly in strange unquietness.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,<br>
When it hath blown his ranks into the air,<br>
And, like the devil, from his very arm<br>
Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?<br>
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:<br>
There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I prithee, do so.<br>
<p><i>Exit IAGO</i><br></p>
Something, sure, of state,<br>
Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise<br>
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,<br>
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases<br>
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,<br>
Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;<br>
For let our finger ache, and it indues<br>
Our other healthful members even to that sense<br>
Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,<br>
Nor of them look for such observances<br>
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,<br>
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,<br>
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;<br>
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,<br>
And he's indicted falsely.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,<br>
And no conception nor no jealous toy<br>
Concerning you.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Alas the day! I never gave him cause.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;<br>
They are not ever jealous for the cause,<br>
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster<br>
Begot upon itself, born on itself.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

Lady, amen.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:<br>
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit<br>
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I humbly thank your ladyship.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA</i><br></p>
<p><i>Enter BIANCA</i><br></p>

<b>BIANCA</b>

Save you, friend Cassio!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

What make you from home?<br>
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?<br>
I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.<br>
What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?<br>
Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,<br>
More tedious than the dial eight score times?<br>
O weary reckoning!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

                  Pardon me, Bianca:<br>
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:<br>
But I shall, in a more continuate time,<br>
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,<br>
<p><i>Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief</i><br></p>
Take me this work out.<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

O Cassio, whence came this?<br>
This is some token from a newer friend:<br>
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:<br>
Is't come to this? Well, well.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Go to, woman!<br>
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,<br>
From whence you have them. You are jealous now<br>
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:<br>
No, in good troth, Bianca.<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

Why, whose is it?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.<br>
I like the work well: ere it be demanded--<br>
As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:<br>
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

Leave you! wherefore?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I do attend here on the general;<br>
And think it no addition, nor my wish,<br>
To have him see me woman'd.<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

Why, I pray you?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Not that I love you not.<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

But that you do not love me.<br>
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,<br>
And say if I shall see you soon at night.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;<br>
For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.<br>

<b>BIANCA</b>

'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.<br>
