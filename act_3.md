<h3>ACT III</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. Before the castle.</h3>
<p></p><br>
<i>Enter CASSIO and some Musicians</i>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.1">Masters, play here; I will content your pains;</span><br>
<span name="3.1.2">Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'</span><br>
<p><i>Music</i></p>
<p><i>Enter Clown</i></p>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.3">Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.4">that they speak i' the nose thus?</span><br>
<br>

<b>First Musician</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.5">How, sir, how!</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.6">Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?</span><br>
<br>

<b>First Musician</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.7">Ay, marry, are they, sir.</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.8">O, thereby hangs a tail.</span><br>
<br>

<b>First Musician</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.9">Whereby hangs a tale, sir?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.10">Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.</span><br>
<span name="3.1.11">But, masters, here's money for you: and the general</span><br>
<span name="3.1.12">so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's</span><br>
<span name="3.1.13">sake, to make no more noise with it.</span><br>
<br>

<b>First Musician</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.14">Well, sir, we will not.</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.15">If you have any music that may not be heard, to't</span><br>
<span name="3.1.16">again: but, as they say to hear music the general</span><br>
<span name="3.1.17">does not greatly care.</span><br>
<br>

<b>First Musician</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.18">We have none such, sir.</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.19">Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:</span><br>
<span name="3.1.20">go; vanish into air; away!</span><br>
<p><i>Exeunt Musicians</i></p>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.21">Dost thou hear, my honest friend?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.22">No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.23">Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece</span><br>
<span name="3.1.24">of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends</span><br>
<span name="3.1.25">the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's</span><br>
<span name="3.1.26">one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:</span><br>
<span name="3.1.27">wilt thou do this?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.28">She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I</span><br>
<span name="3.1.29">shall seem to notify unto her.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.30">Do, good my friend.</span><br>
<p><i>Exit Clown</i></p>
<p><i>Enter IAGO</i></p>
<span name="3.1.31">In happy time, Iago.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.32">You have not been a-bed, then?</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.33">Why, no; the day had broke</span><br>
<span name="3.1.34">Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.35">To send in to your wife: my suit to her</span><br>
<span name="3.1.36">Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona</span><br>
<span name="3.1.37">Procure me some access.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.38">I'll send her to you presently;</span><br>
<span name="3.1.39">And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor</span><br>
<span name="3.1.40">Out of the way, that your converse and business</span><br>
<span name="3.1.41">May be more free.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.42">I humbly thank you for't.</span><br>
<p><i>Exit IAGO</i></p>
<span name="3.1.43">I never knew</span><br>
<span name="3.1.44">A Florentine more kind and honest.</span><br>
<p><i>Enter EMILIA</i></p>
<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.45">Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry</span><br>
<span name="3.1.46">For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.</span><br>
<span name="3.1.47">The general and his wife are talking of it;</span><br>
<span name="3.1.48">And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.49">That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.50">And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom</span><br>
<span name="3.1.51">He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you</span><br>
<span name="3.1.52">And needs no other suitor but his likings</span><br>
<span name="3.1.53">To take the safest occasion by the front</span><br>
<span name="3.1.54">To bring you in again.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.55">Yet, I beseech you,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.56">If you think fit, or that it may be done,</span><br>
<span name="3.1.57">Give me advantage of some brief discourse</span><br>
<span name="3.1.58">With Desdemona alone.</span><br>
<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.59">Pray you, come in;</span><br>
<span name="3.1.60">I will bestow you where you shall have time</span><br>
<span name="3.1.61">To speak your bosom freely.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.1.62">I am much bound to you.</span><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
<br>
<h3>SCENE II. A room in the castle.</h3>
<p></p><br>
<i>Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen</i>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.2.1">These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;</span><br>
<span name="3.2.2">And by him do my duties to the senate:</span><br>
<span name="3.2.3">That done, I will be walking on the works;</span><br>
<span name="3.2.4">Repair there to me.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.2.5">Well, my good lord, I'll do't.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.2.6">This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Gentleman</b>
<br>
<span name="3.2.7">We'll wait upon your lordship.</span><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
<br>
<h3>SCENE III. The garden of the castle.</h3>
<p></p><br>
<i>Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA</i>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.1">Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do</span><br>
<span name="3.3.2">All my abilities in thy behalf.</span><br>
<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.3">Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.4">As if the case were his.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.5">O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.6">But I will have my lord and you again</span><br>
<span name="3.3.7">As friendly as you were.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.8">Bounteous madam,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.9">Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.10">He's never any thing but your true servant.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.11">I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.12">You have known him long; and be you well assured</span><br>
<span name="3.3.13">He shall in strangeness stand no further off</span><br>
<span name="3.3.14">Than in a polite distance.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.15">Ay, but, lady,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.16">That policy may either last so long,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.17">Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.18">Or breed itself so out of circumstance,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.19">That, I being absent and my place supplied,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.20">My general will forget my love and service.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.21">Do not doubt that; before Emilia here</span><br>
<span name="3.3.22">I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.23">If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it</span><br>
<span name="3.3.24">To the last article: my lord shall never rest;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.25">I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.26">His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.27">I'll intermingle every thing he does</span><br>
<span name="3.3.28">With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.29">For thy solicitor shall rather die</span><br>
<span name="3.3.30">Than give thy cause away.</span><br>
<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.31">Madam, here comes my lord.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.32">Madam, I'll take my leave.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.33">Why, stay, and hear me speak.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.34">Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.35">Unfit for mine own purposes.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.36">Well, do your discretion.</span><br>
<p><i>Exit CASSIO</i></p>
<p><i>Enter OTHELLO and IAGO</i></p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.37">Ha! I like not that.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.38">What dost thou say?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.39">Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.40">Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.41">Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.42">That he would steal away so guilty-like,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.43">Seeing you coming.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.44">                  I do believe 'twas he.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.45">How now, my lord!</span><br>
<span name="3.3.46">I have been talking with a suitor here,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.47">A man that languishes in your displeasure.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.48">Who is't you mean?</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.49">Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.50">If I have any grace or power to move you,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.51">His present reconciliation take;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.52">For if he be not one that truly loves you,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.53">That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.54">I have no judgment in an honest face:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.55">I prithee, call him back.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.56">Went he hence now?</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.57">Ay, sooth; so humbled</span><br>
<span name="3.3.58">That he hath left part of his grief with me,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.59">To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.60">Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.61">But shall't be shortly?</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.62">The sooner, sweet, for you.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.63">Shall't be to-night at supper?</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.64">No, not to-night.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.65">To-morrow dinner, then?</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.66">I shall not dine at home;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.67">I meet the captains at the citadel.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.68">Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.69">On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.70">I prithee, name the time, but let it not</span><br>
<span name="3.3.71">Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.72">And yet his trespass, in our common reason--</span><br>
<span name="3.3.73">Save that, they say, the wars must make examples</span><br>
<span name="3.3.74">Out of their best--is not almost a fault</span><br>
<span name="3.3.75">To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?</span><br>
<span name="3.3.76">Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.77">What you would ask me, that I should deny,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.78">Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.79">That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.80">When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.81">Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do</span><br>
<span name="3.3.82">To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.83">Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.84">I will deny thee nothing.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.85">Why, this is not a boon;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.86">'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.87">Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.88">Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit</span><br>
<span name="3.3.89">To your own person: nay, when I have a suit</span><br>
<span name="3.3.90">Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.91">It shall be full of poise and difficult weight</span><br>
<span name="3.3.92">And fearful to be granted.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.93">I will deny thee nothing:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.94">Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.95">To leave me but a little to myself.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.96">Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.97">Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.98">Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.99">Whate'er you be, I am obedient.</span><br>
<p><i>Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA</i></p>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.100">Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.101">But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.102">Chaos is come again.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.103">My noble lord--</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.104">                  What dost thou say, Iago?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.105">Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.106">Know of your love?</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.107">He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.108">But for a satisfaction of my thought;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.109">No further harm.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.110">                  Why of thy thought, Iago?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.111">I did not think he had been acquainted with her.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.112">O, yes; and went between us very oft.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.113">Indeed!</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.114">Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?</span><br>
<span name="3.3.115">Is he not honest?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.116">Honest, my lord!</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.117">                  Honest! ay, honest.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.118">My lord, for aught I know.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.119">What dost thou think?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.120">Think, my lord!</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.121">Think, my lord!</span><br>
<span name="3.3.122">By heaven, he echoes me,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.123">As if there were some monster in his thought</span><br>
<span name="3.3.124">Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.125">I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.126">When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?</span><br>
<span name="3.3.127">And when I told thee he was of my counsel</span><br>
<span name="3.3.128">In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'</span><br>
<span name="3.3.129">And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.130">As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</span><br>
<span name="3.3.131">Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.132">Show me thy thought.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.133">My lord, you know I love you.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.134">I think thou dost;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.135">And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.136">And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.137">Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.138">For such things in a false disloyal knave</span><br>
<span name="3.3.139">Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just</span><br>
<span name="3.3.140">They are close delations, working from the heart</span><br>
<span name="3.3.141">That passion cannot rule.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.142">For Michael Cassio,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.143">I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.144">I think so too.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.145">                  Men should be what they seem;</span><br>
<span name="3.3.146">Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.147">Certain, men should be what they seem.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.148">Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.</span><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.149">Nay, yet there's more in this:</span><br>
<span name="3.3.150">I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,</span><br>
<span name="3.3.151">As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts</span><br>
<span name="3.3.152">The worst of words.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="3.3.153">Good my lord, pardon me:</span><br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.4.4">He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,</span><br>

<br>

<b>Clown</b>

<span name="3.4.8">Can any thing be made of this?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Clown</b>
<br>
<span name="3.4.9">I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a</span><br>

<span name="3.4.41">A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,</span><br>
<span name="3.4.42">Much castigation, exercise devout;</span><br>
<span name="3.4.43">For here's a young and sweating devil here,</span><br>
