<h3>ACT I</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</i><br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>
Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly<br>
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse<br>
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>
'Sblood, but you will not hear me:<br>
If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,<br>
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,<br>
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,<br>
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:<br>
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,<br>
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance<br>
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;<br>
And, in conclusion,<br>
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,<br>
'I have already chose my officer.'<br>
And what was he?<br>
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,<br>
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,<br>
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;<br>
That never set a squadron in the field,<br>
Nor the division of a battle knows<br>
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,<br>
Wherein the toged consuls can propose<br>
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,<br>
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:<br>
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<br>
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds<br>
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd<br>
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,<br>
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,<br>
And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,<br>
Preferment goes by letter and affection,<br>
And not by old gradation, where each second<br>
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,<br>
Whether I in any just term am affined<br>
To love the Moor.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

I would not follow him then.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

O, sir, content you;<br>
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:<br>
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<br>
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark<br>
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,<br>
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,<br>
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,<br>
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:<br>
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are<br>
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,<br>
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,<br>
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,<br>
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined<br>
their coats<br>
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;<br>
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,<br>
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,<br>
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:<br>
In following him, I follow but myself;<br>
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,<br>
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:<br>
For when my outward action doth demonstrate<br>
The native act and figure of my heart<br>
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after<br>
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve<br>
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

What a full fortune does the thicklips owe<br>
If he can carry't thus!<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Call up her father,<br>
Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,<br>
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,<br>
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,<br>
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,<br>
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,<br>
As it may lose some colour.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell<br>
As when, by night and negligence, the fire<br>
Is spied in populous cities.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!<br>
Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!<br>
Thieves! thieves!<br>
<p><i>BRABANTIO appears above, at a window</i><br></p>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

What is the reason of this terrible summons?<br>
What is the matter there?<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Signior, is all your family within?<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Are your doors lock'd?<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

Why, wherefore ask you this?<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on<br>
your gown;<br>
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;<br>
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram<br>
Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;<br>
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,<br>
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:<br>
Arise, I say.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

                  What, have you lost your wits?<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

Not I	what are you?<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

My name is Roderigo.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

The worser welcome:<br>
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:<br>
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say<br>
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,<br>
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,<br>
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come<br>
To start my quiet.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Sir, sir, sir,--<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

                  But thou must needs be sure<br>
My spirit and my place have in them power<br>
To make this bitter to thee.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Patience, good sir.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;<br>
My house is not a grange.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Most grave Brabantio,<br>
In simple and pure soul I come to you.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not<br>
serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to<br>
do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll<br>
have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;<br>
you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have<br>
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

What profane wretch art thou?<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter<br>
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

Thou art a villain.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

You are--a senator.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,<br>
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,<br>
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,<br>
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,<br>
Transported, with no worse nor better guard<br>
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,<br>
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--<br>
If this be known to you and your allowance,<br>
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;<br>
But if you know not this, my manners tell me<br>
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe<br>
That, from the sense of all civility,<br>
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:<br>
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,<br>
I say again, hath made a gross revolt;<br>
Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes<br>
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger<br>
Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:<br>
If she be in her chamber or your house,<br>
Let loose on me the justice of the state<br>
For thus deluding you.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

Strike on the tinder, ho!<br>
Give me a taper! call up all my people!<br>
This accident is not unlike my dream:<br>
Belief of it oppresses me already.<br>
Light, I say! light!<br>
<p><i>Exit above</i><br></p>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Farewell; for I must leave you:<br>
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,<br>
To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--<br>
Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,<br>
However this may gall him with some cheque,<br>
Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd<br>
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,<br>
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,<br>
Another of his fathom they have none,<br>
To lead their business: in which regard,<br>
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.<br>
Yet, for necessity of present life,<br>
I must show out a flag and sign of love,<br>
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,<br>
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;<br>
And there will I be with him. So, farewell.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>
<p><i>Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches</i><br></p>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

It is too true an evil: gone she is;<br>
And what's to come of my despised time<br>
Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,<br>
Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!<br>
With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!<br>
How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me<br>
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:<br>
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Truly, I think they are.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!<br>
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds<br>
By what you see them act. Is there not charms<br>
By which the property of youth and maidhood<br>
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,<br>
Of some such thing?<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Yes, sir, I have indeed.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!<br>
Some one way, some another. Do you know<br>
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

I think I can discover him, if you please,<br>
To get good guard and go along with me.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;<br>
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!<br>
And raise some special officers of night.<br>
On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i><br></p>
<h3>SCENE II. Another street.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches</i><br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Though in the trade of war I have slain men,<br>
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience<br>
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity<br>
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times<br>
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

'Tis better as it is.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Nay, but he prated,<br>
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms<br>
Against your honour<br>
That, with the little godliness I have,<br>
I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,<br>
Are you fast married? Be assured of this,<br>
That the magnifico is much beloved,<br>
And hath in his effect a voice potential<br>
As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;<br>
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance<br>
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,<br>
Will give him cable.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

Let him do his spite:<br>
My services which I have done the signiory<br>
Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--<br>
Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,<br>
I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being<br>
From men of royal siege, and my demerits<br>
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune<br>
As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,<br>
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,<br>
I would not my unhoused free condition<br>
Put into circumscription and confine<br>
For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Those are the raised father and his friends:<br>
You were best go in.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

Not I	I must be found:<br>
My parts, my title and my perfect soul<br>
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

By Janus, I think no.<br>
<p><i>Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches</i><br></p>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.<br>
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!<br>
What is the news?<br>

<h5>CASSIO</h5><br>

                  The duke does greet you, general,<br>
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,<br>
Even on the instant.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

What is the matter, think you?<br>

<h5>CASSIO</h5><br>

Something from Cyprus as I may divine:<br>
It is a business of some heat: the galleys<br>
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers<br>
This very night at one another's heels,<br>
And many of the consuls, raised and met,<br>
Are at the duke's already: you have been<br>
hotly call'd for;<br>
When, being not at your lodging to be found,<br>
The senate hath sent about three several guests<br>
To search you out.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

'Tis well I am found by you.<br>
I will but spend a word here in the house,<br>
And go with you.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>

<h5>CASSIO</h5><br>

                  Ancient, what makes he here?<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:<br>
If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.<br>

<h5>CASSIO</h5><br>

I do not understand.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

He's married.<br>

<h5>CASSIO</h5><br>

To who?<br>
<p><i>Re-enter OTHELLO</i><br></p>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

Have with you.<br>

<h5>CASSIO</h5><br>

Here comes another troop to seek for you.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

It is Brabantio. General, be advised;<br>
He comes to bad intent.<br>
<p><i>Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons</i><br></p>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

Holla! stand there!<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Signior, it is the Moor.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

Down with him, thief!<br>
<p><i>They draw on both sides</i><br></p>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.<br>
Good signior, you shall more command with years<br>
Than with your weapons.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?<br>
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;<br>
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,<br>
If she in chains of magic were not bound,<br>
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,<br>
So opposite to marriage that she shunned<br>
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,<br>
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,<br>
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom<br>
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.<br>
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense<br>
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,<br>
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals<br>
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;<br>
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.<br>
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee<br>
For an abuser of the world, a practiser<br>
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.<br>
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,<br>
Subdue him at his peril.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

Hold your hands,<br>
Both you of my inclining, and the rest:<br>
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it<br>
Without a prompter. Where will you that I go<br>
To answer this your charge?<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

To prison, till fit time<br>
Of law and course of direct session<br>
Call thee to answer.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

What if I do obey?<br>
How may the duke be therewith satisfied,<br>
Whose messengers are here about my side,<br>
Upon some present business of the state<br>
To bring me to him?<br>

<h5>First Officer</h5><br>

'Tis true, most worthy signior;<br>
The duke's in council and your noble self,<br>
I am sure, is sent for.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

How! the duke in council!<br>
In this time of the night! Bring him away:<br>
Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,<br>
Or any of my brothers of the state,<br>
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;<br>
For if such actions may have passage free,<br>
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i><br></p>
<h3>SCENE III. A council-chamber.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending</i><br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

There is no composition in these news<br>
That gives them credit.<br>

<h5>First Senator</h5><br>

Indeed, they are disproportion'd;<br>
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

And mine, a hundred and forty.<br>

<h5>Second Senator</h5><br>

And mine, two hundred:<br>
But though they jump not on a just account,--<br>
As in these cases, where the aim reports,<br>
'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm<br>
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:<br>
I do not so secure me in the error,<br>
But the main article I do approve<br>
In fearful sense.<br>

<h5>Sailor</h5><br>

[Within]  What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!<br>

<h5>First Officer</h5><br>

A messenger from the galleys.<br>
<p><i>Enter a Sailor</i><br></p>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Now, what's the business?<br>

<h5>Sailor</h5><br>

The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;<br>
So was I bid report here to the state<br>
By Signior Angelo.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

How say you by this change?<br>

<h5>First Senator</h5><br>

This cannot be,<br>
By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,<br>
To keep us in false gaze. When we consider<br>
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,<br>
And let ourselves again but understand,<br>
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,<br>
So may he with more facile question bear it,<br>
For that it stands not in such warlike brace,<br>
But altogether lacks the abilities<br>
That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,<br>
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful<br>
To leave that latest which concerns him first,<br>
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,<br>
To wake and wage a danger profitless.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.<br>

<h5>First Officer</h5><br>

Here is more news.<br>
<p><i>Enter a Messenger</i><br></p>

<h5>Messenger</h5><br>

The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,<br>
Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,<br>
Have there injointed them with an after fleet.<br>

<h5>First Senator</h5><br>

Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?<br>

<h5>Messenger</h5><br>

Of thirty sail: and now they do restem<br>
Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance<br>
Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,<br>
Your trusty and most valiant servitor,<br>
With his free duty recommends you thus,<br>
And prays you to believe him.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.<br>
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?<br>

<h5>First Senator</h5><br>

He's now in Florence.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.<br>

<h5>First Senator</h5><br>

Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.<br>
<p><i>Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers</i><br></p>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you<br>
Against the general enemy Ottoman.<br>
<p><i>To BRABANTIO</i><br></p>
I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;<br>
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;<br>
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business<br>
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care<br>
Take hold on me, for my particular grief<br>
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature<br>
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows<br>
And it is still itself.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Why, what's the matter?<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

My daughter! O, my daughter!<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

<h5>Senator</h5><br>

Dead?<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

Ay, to me;<br>
She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted<br>
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;<br>
For nature so preposterously to err,<br>
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,<br>
Sans witchcraft could not.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding<br>
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself<br>
And you of her, the bloody book of law<br>
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter<br>
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son<br>
Stood in your action.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

Humbly I thank your grace.<br>
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,<br>
Your special mandate for the state-affairs<br>
Hath hither brought.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

<h5>Senator</h5><br>

We are very sorry for't.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

[To OTHELLO]  What, in your own part, can you say to this?<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

Nothing, but this is so.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,<br>
My very noble and approved good masters,<br>
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,<br>
It is most true; true, I have married her:<br>
The very head and front of my offending<br>
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,<br>
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:<br>
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,<br>
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used<br>
Their dearest action in the tented field,<br>
And little of this great world can I speak,<br>
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,<br>
And therefore little shall I grace my cause<br>
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,<br>
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver<br>
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,<br>
What conjuration and what mighty magic,<br>
For such proceeding I am charged withal,<br>
I won his daughter.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

A maiden never bold;<br>
Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion<br>
Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,<br>
Of years, of country, credit, every thing,<br>
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!<br>
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect<br>
That will confess perfection so could err<br>
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven<br>
To find out practises of cunning hell,<br>
Why this should be. I therefore vouch again<br>
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,<br>
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,<br>
He wrought upon her.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

To vouch this, is no proof,<br>
Without more wider and more overt test<br>
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods<br>
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.<br>

<h5>First Senator</h5><br>

But, Othello, speak:<br>
Did you by indirect and forced courses<br>
Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?<br>
Or came it by request and such fair question<br>
As soul to soul affordeth?<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

I do beseech you,<br>
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,<br>
And let her speak of me before her father:<br>
If you do find me foul in her report,<br>
The trust, the office I do hold of you,<br>
Not only take away, but let your sentence<br>
Even fall upon my life.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Fetch Desdemona hither.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt IAGO and Attendants</i><br></p>
And, till she come, as truly as to heaven<br>
I do confess the vices of my blood,<br>
So justly to your grave ears I'll present<br>
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,<br>
And she in mine.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Say it, Othello.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

Her father loved me; oft invited me;<br>
Still question'd me the story of my life,<br>
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,<br>
That I have passed.<br>
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,<br>
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;<br>
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,<br>
Of moving accidents by flood and field<br>
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,<br>
Of being taken by the insolent foe<br>
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence<br>
And portance in my travels' history:<br>
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,<br>
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven<br>
It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;<br>
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,<br>
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads<br>
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear<br>
Would Desdemona seriously incline:<br>
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:<br>
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,<br>
She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear<br>
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,<br>
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means<br>
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart<br>
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,<br>
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<br>
But not intentively: I did consent,<br>
And often did beguile her of her tears,<br>
When I did speak of some distressful stroke<br>
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,<br>
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:<br>
She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,<br>
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:<br>
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd<br>
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,<br>
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,<br>
I should but teach him how to tell my story.<br>
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:<br>
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,<br>
And I loved her that she did pity them.<br>
This only is the witchcraft I have used:<br>
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.<br>
<p><i>Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants</i><br></p>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

I think this tale would win my daughter too.<br>
Good Brabantio,<br>
Take up this mangled matter at the best:<br>
Men do their broken weapons rather use<br>
Than their bare hands.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

I pray you, hear her speak:<br>
If she confess that she was half the wooer,<br>
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame<br>
Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:<br>
Do you perceive in all this noble company<br>
Where most you owe obedience?<br>

<h5>DESDEMONA</h5><br>

My noble father,<br>
I do perceive here a divided duty:<br>
To you I am bound for life and education;<br>
My life and education both do learn me<br>
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;<br>
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,<br>
And so much duty as my mother show'd<br>
To you, preferring you before her father,<br>
So much I challenge that I may profess<br>
Due to the Moor my lord.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

God be wi' you! I have done.<br>
Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:<br>
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.<br>
Come hither, Moor:<br>
I here do give thee that with all my heart<br>
Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart<br>
I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,<br>
I am glad at soul I have no other child:<br>
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,<br>
To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,<br>
Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers<br>
Into your favour.<br>
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended<br>
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.<br>
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone<br>
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.<br>
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes<br>
Patience her injury a mockery makes.<br>
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;<br>
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;<br>
We lose it not, so long as we can smile.<br>
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears<br>
But the free comfort which from thence he hears,<br>
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow<br>
That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.<br>
These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,<br>
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:<br>
But words are words; I never yet did hear<br>
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.<br>
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for<br>
Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best<br>
known to you; and though we have there a substitute<br>
of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a<br>
sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer<br>
voice on you: you must therefore be content to<br>
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this<br>
more stubborn and boisterous expedition.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

The tyrant custom, most grave senators,<br>
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war<br>
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise<br>
A natural and prompt alacrity<br>
I find in hardness, and do undertake<br>
These present wars against the Ottomites.<br>
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,<br>
I crave fit disposition for my wife.<br>
Due reference of place and exhibition,<br>
With such accommodation and besort<br>
As levels with her breeding.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

If you please,<br>
Be't at her father's.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

I'll not have it so.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

Nor I.<br>

<h5>DESDEMONA</h5><br>

     Nor I; I would not there reside,<br>
To put my father in impatient thoughts<br>
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,<br>
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;<br>
And let me find a charter in your voice,<br>
To assist my simpleness.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

What would You, Desdemona?<br>

<h5>DESDEMONA</h5><br>

That I did love the Moor to live with him,<br>
My downright violence and storm of fortunes<br>
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued<br>
Even to the very quality of my lord:<br>
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,<br>
And to his honour and his valiant parts<br>
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.<br>
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,<br>
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,<br>
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,<br>
And I a heavy interim shall support<br>
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

Let her have your voices.<br>
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,<br>
To please the palate of my appetite,<br>
Nor to comply with heat--the young affects<br>
In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.<br>
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:<br>
And heaven defend your good souls, that you think<br>
I will your serious and great business scant<br>
For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys<br>
Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness<br>
My speculative and officed instruments,<br>
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,<br>
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,<br>
And all indign and base adversities<br>
Make head against my estimation!<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Be it as you shall privately determine,<br>
Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,<br>
And speed must answer it.<br>

<h5>First Senator</h5><br>

You must away to-night.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

With all my heart.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.<br>
Othello, leave some officer behind,<br>
And he shall our commission bring to you;<br>
With such things else of quality and respect<br>
As doth import you.<br>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

So please your grace, my ancient;<br>
A man he is of honest and trust:<br>
To his conveyance I assign my wife,<br>
With what else needful your good grace shall think<br>
To be sent after me.<br>

<h5>DUKE OF VENICE</h5><br>

Let it be so.<br>
Good night to every one.<br>
<p><i>To BRABANTIO</i><br></p>
And, noble signior,<br>
If virtue no delighted beauty lack,<br>
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.<br>

<h5>First Senator</h5><br>

Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.<br>

<h5>BRABANTIO</h5><br>

Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:<br>
She has deceived her father, and may thee.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers,  &amp; c</i><br></p>

<h5>OTHELLO</h5><br>

My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,<br>
My Desdemona must I leave to thee:<br>
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:<br>
And bring them after in the best advantage.<br>
Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour<br>
Of love, of worldly matters and direction,<br>
To spend with thee: we must obey the time.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA</i><br></p>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Iago,--<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

What say'st thou, noble heart?<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

What will I do, thinkest thou?<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Why, go to bed, and sleep.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

I will incontinently drown myself.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,<br>
thou silly gentleman!<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and<br>
then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four<br>
times seven years; and since I could distinguish<br>
betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man<br>
that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I<br>
would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I<br>
would change my humanity with a baboon.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so<br>
fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus<br>
or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which<br>
our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant<br>
nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up<br>
thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or<br>
distract it with many, either to have it sterile<br>
with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the<br>
power and corrigible authority of this lies in our<br>
wills. If the balance of our lives had not one<br>
scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the<br>
blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us<br>
to most preposterous conclusions: but we have<br>
reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal<br>
stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that<br>
you call love to be a sect or scion.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

It cannot be.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of<br>
the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown<br>
cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy<br>
friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with<br>
cables of perdurable toughness; I could never<br>
better stead thee than now. Put money in thy<br>
purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with<br>
an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It<br>
cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her<br>
love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he<br>
his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou<br>
shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but<br>
money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in<br>
their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food<br>
that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be<br>
to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must<br>
change for youth: when she is sated with his body,<br>
she will find the error of her choice: she must<br>
have change, she must: therefore put money in thy<br>
purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a<br>
more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money<br>
thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt<br>
an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not<br>
too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou<br>
shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of<br>
drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek<br>
thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than<br>
to be drowned and go without her.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on<br>
the issue?<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told<br>
thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I<br>
hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no<br>
less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge<br>
against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost<br>
thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many<br>
events in the womb of time which will be delivered.<br>
Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more<br>
of this to-morrow. Adieu.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

Where shall we meet i' the morning?<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

At my lodging.<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

I'll be with thee betimes.<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

What say you?<br>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

No more of drowning, do you hear?<br>

<h5>RODERIGO</h5><br>

I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>

<h5>IAGO</h5><br>

Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:<br>
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,<br>
If I would time expend with such a snipe.<br>
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:<br>
And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets<br>
He has done my office: I know not if't be true;<br>
But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,<br>
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;<br>
The better shall my purpose work on him.<br>
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:<br>
To get his place and to plume up my will<br>
In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--<br>
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear<br>
That he is too familiar with his wife.<br>
He hath a person and a smooth dispose<br>
To be suspected, framed to make women false.<br>
The Moor is of a free and open nature,<br>
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,<br>
And will as tenderly be led by the nose<br>
As asses are.<br>
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night<br>
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>
