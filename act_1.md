</div>

</span name="speech1"><b>RODERIGO</b></span>
<div>
</span name="1.1.1">Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly</span><br>
</span name="1.1.2">That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</span><br>
</span name="1.1.3">As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</span><br>
</div>

</span name="speech2"><b>IAGO</b></span>
<div>
</span name="1.1.4">'Sblood, but you will not hear me:</span><br>
</span name="1.1.5">If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</span><br>
</div>

</span name="speech3"><b>RODERIGO</b></span>
<div>
</span name="1.1.6">Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</span><br>
</div>

</span name="speech4"><b>IAGO</b></span>
<div>
</span name="1.1.7">Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.8">In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.9">Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.10">I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</span><br>
</span name="1.1.11">But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.12">Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</span><br>
</span name="1.1.13">Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;</span><br>
</span name="1.1.14">And, in conclusion,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.15">Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.16">'I have already chose my officer.'</span><br>
</span name="1.1.17">And what was he?</span><br>
</span name="1.1.18">Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.19">One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.20">A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;</span><br>
</span name="1.1.21">That never set a squadron in the field,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.22">Nor the division of a battle knows</span><br>
</span name="1.1.23">More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.24">Wherein the toged consuls can propose</span><br>
</span name="1.1.25">As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.26">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</span><br>
</span name="1.1.27">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</span><br>
</span name="1.1.28">At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</span><br>
</span name="1.1.29">Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</span><br>
</span name="1.1.30">By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.31">He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.32">And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</span><br>
</div>

</span name="speech5"><b>RODERIGO</b></span>
<div>
</span name="1.1.33">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</span><br>
</div>

</span name="speech6"><b>IAGO</b></span>
<div>
</span name="1.1.34">Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.35">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.36">And not by old gradation, where each second</span><br>
</span name="1.1.37">Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.38">Whether I in any just term am affined</span><br>
</span name="1.1.39">To love the Moor.</span><br>
</div>

</span name="speech7"><b>RODERIGO</b></span>
<div>
</span name="1.1.40">I would not follow him then.</span><br>
</div>

</span name="speech8"><b>IAGO</b></span>
<div>
</span name="1.1.41">O, sir, content you;</span><br>
</span name="1.1.42">I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</span><br>
</span name="1.1.43">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</span><br>
</span name="1.1.44">Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</span><br>
</span name="1.1.45">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.46">That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.47">Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.48">For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</span><br>
</span name="1.1.49">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</span><br>
</span name="1.1.50">Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.51">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.52">And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.53">Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</span><br>
</span name="1.1.54">their coats</span><br>
</span name="1.1.55">Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</span><br>
</span name="1.1.56">And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.57">It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.58">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</span><br>
</span name="1.1.59">In following him, I follow but myself;</span><br>
</span name="1.1.60">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.61">But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</span><br>
</span name="1.1.62">For when my outward action doth demonstrate</span><br>
</span name="1.1.63">The native act and figure of my heart</span><br>
</span name="1.1.64">In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</span><br>
</span name="1.1.65">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</span><br>
</span name="1.1.66">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</span><br>
</div>

</span name="speech9"><b>RODERIGO</b></span>
<div>
</span name="1.1.67">What a full fortune does the thicklips owe</span><br>
</span name="1.1.68">If he can carry't thus!</span><br>
</div>

</span name="speech10"><b>IAGO</b></span>
<div>
</span name="1.1.69">Call up her father,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.70">Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.71">Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.72">And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.73">Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.74">Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,</span><br>
</span name="1.1.75">As it may lose some colour.</span><br>
