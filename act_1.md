<h3>ACT I</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</i>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly</span> <i class="place">1.1.1</i><br>
<span>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</span> <i class="place">1.1.2</i><br>
<span>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</span> <i class="place">1.1.3</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>'Sblood, but you will not hear me:</span> <i class="place">1.1.4</i><br>
<span>If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</span> <i class="place">1.1.5</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</span> <i class="place">1.1.6</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</span> <i class="place">1.1.7</i><br>
<span>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</span> <i class="place">1.1.8</i><br>
<span>Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,</span> <i class="place">1.1.9</i><br>
<span>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</span> <i class="place">1.1.10</i><br>
<span>But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</span> <i class="place">1.1.11</i><br>
<span>Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</span> <i class="place">1.1.12</i><br>
<span>Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;</span> <i class="place">1.1.13</i><br>
<span>And, in conclusion,</span> <i class="place">1.1.14</i><br>
<span>Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,</span> <i class="place">1.1.15</i><br>
<span>'I have already chose my officer.'</span> <i class="place">1.1.16</i><br>
<span>And what was he?</span> <i class="place">1.1.17</i><br>
<span>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</span> <i class="place">1.1.18</i><br>
<span>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</span> <i class="place">1.1.19</i><br>
<span>A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;</span> <i class="place">1.1.20</i><br>
<span>That never set a squadron in the field,</span> <i class="place">1.1.21</i><br>
<span>Nor the division of a battle knows</span> <i class="place">1.1.22</i><br>
<span>More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</span> <i class="place">1.1.23</i><br>
<span>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</span> <i class="place">1.1.24</i><br>
<span>As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</span> <i class="place">1.1.25</i><br>
<span>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</span> <i class="place">1.1.26</i><br>
<span>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</span> <i class="place">1.1.27</i><br>
<span>At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</span> <i class="place">1.1.28</i><br>
<span>Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</span> <i class="place">1.1.29</i><br>
<span>By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</span> <i class="place">1.1.30</i><br>
<span>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</span> <i class="place">1.1.31</i><br>
<span>And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</span> <i class="place">1.1.32</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</span> <i class="place">1.1.33</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</span> <i class="place">1.1.34</i><br>
<span>Preferment goes by letter and affection,</span> <i class="place">1.1.35</i><br>
<span>And not by old gradation, where each second</span> <i class="place">1.1.36</i><br>
<span>Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</span> <i class="place">1.1.37</i><br>
<span>Whether I in any just term am affined</span> <i class="place">1.1.38</i><br>
<span>To love the Moor.</span> <i class="place">1.1.39</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>I would not follow him then.</span> <i class="place">1.1.40</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>O, sir, content you;</span> <i class="place">1.1.41</i><br>
<span>I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</span> <i class="place">1.1.42</i><br>
<span>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</span> <i class="place">1.1.43</i><br>
<span>Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</span> <i class="place">1.1.44</i><br>
<span>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</span> <i class="place">1.1.45</i><br>
<span>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</span> <i class="place">1.1.46</i><br>
<span>Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</span> <i class="place">1.1.47</i><br>
<span>For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</span> <i class="place">1.1.48</i><br>
<span>Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</span> <i class="place">1.1.49</i><br>
<span>Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</span> <i class="place">1.1.50</i><br>
<span>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</span> <i class="place">1.1.51</i><br>
<span>And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</span> <i class="place">1.1.52</i><br>
<span>Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</span> <i class="place">1.1.53</i><br>
<span>their coats</span> <i class="place">1.1.54</i><br>
<span>Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</span> <i class="place">1.1.55</i><br>
<span>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</span> <i class="place">1.1.56</i><br>
<span>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</span> <i class="place">1.1.57</i><br>
<span>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</span> <i class="place">1.1.58</i><br>
<span>In following him, I follow but myself;</span> <i class="place">1.1.59</i><br>
<span>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</span> <i class="place">1.1.60</i><br>
<span>But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</span> <i class="place">1.1.61</i><br>
<span>For when my outward action doth demonstrate</span> <i class="place">1.1.62</i><br>
<span>The native act and figure of my heart</span> <i class="place">1.1.63</i><br>
<span>In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</span> <i class="place">1.1.64</i><br>
<span>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</span> <i class="place">1.1.65</i><br>
<span>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</span> <i class="place">1.1.66</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>What a full fortune does the thicklips owe</span> <i class="place">1.1.67</i><br>
<span>If he can carry't thus!</span> <i class="place">1.1.68</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Call up her father,</span> <i class="place">1.1.69</i><br>
<span>Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,</span> <i class="place">1.1.70</i><br>
<span>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</span> <i class="place">1.1.71</i><br>
<span>And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</span> <i class="place">1.1.72</i><br>
<span>Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</span> <i class="place">1.1.73</i><br>
<span>Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,</span> <i class="place">1.1.74</i><br>
<span>As it may lose some colour.</span> <i class="place">1.1.75</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.</span> <i class="place">1.1.76</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</span> <i class="place">1.1.77</i><br>
<span>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</span> <i class="place">1.1.78</i><br>
<span>Is spied in populous cities.</span> <i class="place">1.1.79</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</span> <i class="place">1.1.80</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!</span> <i class="place">1.1.81</i><br>
<span>Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!</span> <i class="place">1.1.82</i><br>
<span>Thieves! thieves!</span> <i class="place">1.1.83</i><br>
<p><i>BRABANTIO appears above, at a window</i></p>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>What is the reason of this terrible summons?</span> <i class="place">1.1.84</i><br>
<span>What is the matter there?</span> <i class="place">1.1.85</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>Signior, is all your family within?</span> <i class="place">1.1.86</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Are your doors lock'd?</span> <i class="place">1.1.87</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>Why, wherefore ask you this?</span> <i class="place">1.1.88</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on</span> <i class="place">1.1.89</i><br>
<span>your gown;</span> <i class="place">1.1.90</i><br>
<span>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</span> <i class="place">1.1.91</i><br>
<span>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</span> <i class="place">1.1.92</i><br>
<span>Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;</span> <i class="place">1.1.93</i><br>
<span>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</span> <i class="place">1.1.94</i><br>
<span>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:</span> <i class="place">1.1.95</i><br>
<span>Arise, I say.</span> <i class="place">1.1.96</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>                  What, have you lost your wits?</span> <i class="place">1.1.97</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</span> <i class="place">1.1.98</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>Not I	what are you?</span> <i class="place">1.1.99</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>My name is Roderigo.</span> <i class="place">1.1.100</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>The worser welcome:</span> <i class="place">1.1.101</i><br>
<span>I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:</span> <i class="place">1.1.102</i><br>
<span>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</span> <i class="place">1.1.103</i><br>
<span>My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,</span> <i class="place">1.1.104</i><br>
<span>Being full of supper and distempering draughts,</span> <i class="place">1.1.105</i><br>
<span>Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come</span> <i class="place">1.1.106</i><br>
<span>To start my quiet.</span> <i class="place">1.1.107</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>Sir, sir, sir,--</span> <i class="place">1.1.108</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>                  But thou must needs be sure</span> <i class="place">1.1.109</i><br>
<span>My spirit and my place have in them power</span> <i class="place">1.1.110</i><br>
<span>To make this bitter to thee.</span> <i class="place">1.1.111</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>Patience, good sir.</span> <i class="place">1.1.112</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;</span> <i class="place">1.1.113</i><br>
<span>My house is not a grange.</span> <i class="place">1.1.114</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>Most grave Brabantio,</span> <i class="place">1.1.115</i><br>
<span>In simple and pure soul I come to you.</span> <i class="place">1.1.116</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not</span> <i class="place">1.1.117</i><br>
<span>serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to</span> <i class="place">1.1.118</i><br>
<span>do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll</span> <i class="place">1.1.119</i><br>
<span>have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;</span> <i class="place">1.1.120</i><br>
<span>you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have</span> <i class="place">1.1.121</i><br>
<span>coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.</span> <i class="place">1.1.122</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>What profane wretch art thou?</span> <i class="place">1.1.123</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter</span> <i class="place">1.1.124</i><br>
<span>and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</span> <i class="place">1.1.125</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>Thou art a villain.</span> <i class="place">1.1.126</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>You are--a senator.</span> <i class="place">1.1.127</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.</span> <i class="place">1.1.128</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,</span> <i class="place">1.1.129</i><br>
<span>If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,</span> <i class="place">1.1.130</i><br>
<span>As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,</span> <i class="place">1.1.131</i><br>
<span>At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,</span> <i class="place">1.1.132</i><br>
<span>Transported, with no worse nor better guard</span> <i class="place">1.1.133</i><br>
<span>But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</span> <i class="place">1.1.134</i><br>
<span>To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--</span> <i class="place">1.1.135</i><br>
<span>If this be known to you and your allowance,</span> <i class="place">1.1.136</i><br>
<span>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</span> <i class="place">1.1.137</i><br>
<span>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</span> <i class="place">1.1.138</i><br>
<span>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</span> <i class="place">1.1.139</i><br>
<span>That, from the sense of all civility,</span> <i class="place">1.1.140</i><br>
<span>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:</span> <i class="place">1.1.141</i><br>
<span>Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</span> <i class="place">1.1.142</i><br>
<span>I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</span> <i class="place">1.1.143</i><br>
<span>Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</span> <i class="place">1.1.144</i><br>
<span>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</span> <i class="place">1.1.145</i><br>
<span>Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:</span> <i class="place">1.1.146</i><br>
<span>If she be in her chamber or your house,</span> <i class="place">1.1.147</i><br>
<span>Let loose on me the justice of the state</span> <i class="place">1.1.148</i><br>
<span>For thus deluding you.</span> <i class="place">1.1.149</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>Strike on the tinder, ho!</span> <i class="place">1.1.150</i><br>
<span>Give me a taper! call up all my people!</span> <i class="place">1.1.151</i><br>
<span>This accident is not unlike my dream:</span> <i class="place">1.1.152</i><br>
<span>Belief of it oppresses me already.</span> <i class="place">1.1.153</i><br>
<span>Light, I say! light!</span> <i class="place">1.1.154</i><br>
<p><i>Exit above</i></p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Farewell; for I must leave you:</span> <i class="place">1.1.155</i><br>
<span>It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</span> <i class="place">1.1.156</i><br>
<span>To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--</span> <i class="place">1.1.157</i><br>
<span>Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,</span> <i class="place">1.1.158</i><br>
<span>However this may gall him with some cheque,</span> <i class="place">1.1.159</i><br>
<span>Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd</span> <i class="place">1.1.160</i><br>
<span>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</span> <i class="place">1.1.161</i><br>
<span>Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,</span> <i class="place">1.1.162</i><br>
<span>Another of his fathom they have none,</span> <i class="place">1.1.163</i><br>
<span>To lead their business: in which regard,</span> <i class="place">1.1.164</i><br>
<span>Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.</span> <i class="place">1.1.165</i><br>
<span>Yet, for necessity of present life,</span> <i class="place">1.1.166</i><br>
<span>I must show out a flag and sign of love,</span> <i class="place">1.1.167</i><br>
<span>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</span> <i class="place">1.1.168</i><br>
<span>Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;</span> <i class="place">1.1.169</i><br>
<span>And there will I be with him. So, farewell.</span> <i class="place">1.1.170</i><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
<p><i>Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches</i></p>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>It is too true an evil: gone she is;</span> <i class="place">1.1.171</i><br>
<span>And what's to come of my despised time</span> <i class="place">1.1.172</i><br>
<span>Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,</span> <i class="place">1.1.173</i><br>
<span>Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!</span> <i class="place">1.1.174</i><br>
<span>With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!</span> <i class="place">1.1.175</i><br>
<span>How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me</span> <i class="place">1.1.176</i><br>
<span>Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:</span> <i class="place">1.1.177</i><br>
<span>Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?</span> <i class="place">1.1.178</i><br>

<span>By what you see them act. Is there not charms</span> <i class="place">1.1.182</i><br>
<span>By which the property of youth and maidhood</span> <i class="place">1.1.183</i><br>
<span>May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,</span> <i class="place">1.1.184</i><br>
<span>Of some such thing?</span> <i class="place">1.1.185</i><br>
<br>

<span>Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!</span> <i class="place">1.1.187</i><br>
<span>Some one way, some another. Do you know</span> <i class="place">1.1.188</i><br>
<span>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</span> <i class="place">1.1.189</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>I think I can discover him, if you please,</span> <i class="place">1.1.190</i><br>
<span>To get good guard and go along with me.</span> <i class="place">1.1.191</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;</span> <i class="place">1.1.192</i><br>
<span>I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!</span> <i class="place">1.1.193</i><br>
<span>And raise some special officers of night.</span> <i class="place">1.1.194</i><br>
<span>On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.</span> <i class="place">1.1.195</i><br>

<h3>SCENE II. Another street.</h3>
<p></p><br>
<i>Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches</i>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Though in the trade of war I have slain men,</span> <i class="place">1.2.1</i><br>
<span>Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience</span> <i class="place">1.2.2</i><br>
<span>To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity</span> <i class="place">1.2.3</i><br>
<span>Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times</span> <i class="place">1.2.4</i><br>
<span>I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.</span> <i class="place">1.2.5</i><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>
<br>
<span>'Tis better as it is.</span> <i class="place">1.2.6</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Nay, but he prated,</span> <i class="place">1.2.7</i><br>
<span>And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms</span> <i class="place">1.2.8</i><br>
<span>Against your honour</span> <i class="place">1.2.9</i><br>

<span>That the magnifico is much beloved,</span> <i class="place">1.2.13</i><br>
<span>And hath in his effect a voice potential</span> <i class="place">1.2.14</i><br>
<span>As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;</span> <i class="place">1.2.15</i><br>
<span>Or put upon you what restraint and grievance</span> <i class="place">1.2.16</i><br>
<span>The law, with all his might to enforce it on,</span> <i class="place">1.2.17</i><br>

<b>DUKE OF VENICE</b>
<br>
<span>There is no composition in these news</span> <i class="place">1.3.1</i><br>
<span>That gives them credit.</span> <i class="place">1.3.2</i><br>
<br>

<b>First Senator</b>
<br>
<span>Indeed, they are disproportion'd;</span> <i class="place">1.3.3</i><br>
<span>My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.</span> <i class="place">1.3.4</i><br>
<br>

<b>DUKE OF VENICE</b>
<br>
<span>And mine, a hundred and forty.</span> <i class="place">1.3.5</i><br>
<br>

<b>Second Senator</b>
<br>
<span>And mine, two hundred:</span> <i class="place">1.3.6</i><br>
<span>But though they jump not on a just account,--</span> <i class="place">1.3.7</i><br>
<span>As in these cases, where the aim reports,</span> <i class="place">1.3.8</i><br>
<span>'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm</span> <i class="place">1.3.9</i><br>
<span>A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.</span> <i class="place">1.3.10</i><br>
<br>

<b>DUKE OF VENICE</b>
<br>
<span>Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:</span> <i class="place">1.3.11</i><br>
<span>I do not so secure me in the error,</span> <i class="place">1.3.12</i><br>
<span>But the main article I do approve</span> <i class="place">1.3.13</i><br>
<span>In fearful sense.</span> <i class="place">1.3.14</i><br>

<br>
<span>Now, what's the business?</span> <i class="place">1.3.17</i><br>

<b>Sailor</b>
<br>
<span>The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;</span> <i class="place">1.3.18</i><br>
<span>So was I bid report here to the state</span> <i class="place">1.3.19</i><br>
<span>By Signior Angelo.</span> <i class="place">1.3.20</i><br>

<span>How say you by this change?</span> <i class="place">1.3.21</i><br>
<br>

<b>First Senator</b>
<br>
<span>This cannot be,</span> <i class="place">1.3.22</i><br>
<span>By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,</span> <i class="place">1.3.23</i><br>
<span>To keep us in false gaze. When we consider</span> <i class="place">1.3.24</i><br>
<span>The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,</span> <i class="place">1.3.25</i><br>
<span>And let ourselves again but understand,</span> <i class="place">1.3.26</i><br>
<span>That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,</span> <i class="place">1.3.27</i><br>
<span>So may he with more facile question bear it,</span> <i class="place">1.3.28</i><br>
<span>For that it stands not in such warlike brace,</span> <i class="place">1.3.29</i><br>
<span>But altogether lacks the abilities</span> <i class="place">1.3.30</i><br>
<span>That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,</span> <i class="place">1.3.31</i><br>
<span>We must not think the Turk is so unskilful</span> <i class="place">1.3.32</i><br>
<span>To leave that latest which concerns him first,</span> <i class="place">1.3.33</i><br>
<span>Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,</span> <i class="place">1.3.34</i><br>
<span>To wake and wage a danger profitless.</span> <i class="place">1.3.35</i><br>
<br>

<b>DUKE OF VENICE</b>

<br>
<span>Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?</span> <i class="place">1.3.41</i><br>

<span>[To OTHELLO]  What, in your own part, can you say to this?</span> <i class="place">1.3.84</i><br>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<span>Nothing, but this is so.</span> <i class="place">1.3.85</i><br>
<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

<span>Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,</span> <i class="place">1.3.86</i><br>
<span>My very noble and approved good masters,</span> <i class="place">1.3.87</i><br>
<span>That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,</span> <i class="place">1.3.88</i><br>
<span>It is most true; true, I have married her:</span> <i class="place">1.3.89</i><br>
<span>The very head and front of my offending</span> <i class="place">1.3.90</i><br>
<span>Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</span> <i class="place">1.3.91</i><br>
<span>And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:</span> <i class="place">1.3.92</i><br>
<span>For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,</span> <i class="place">1.3.93</i><br>
<span>Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used</span> <i class="place">1.3.94</i><br>
<span>Their dearest action in the tented field,</span> <i class="place">1.3.95</i><br>
<span>And little of this great world can I speak,</span> <i class="place">1.3.96</i><br>
<span>More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,</span> <i class="place">1.3.97</i><br>

<span>Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,</span> <i class="place">1.3.101</i><br>
<span>What conjuration and what mighty magic,</span> <i class="place">1.3.102</i><br>

<span>Of years, of country, credit, every thing,</span> <i class="place">1.3.108</i><br>
<span>To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!</span> <i class="place">1.3.109</i><br>
<span>It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect</span> <i class="place">1.3.110</i><br>
<span>That will confess perfection so could err</span> <i class="place">1.3.111</i><br>
<span>Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</span> <i class="place">1.3.112</i><br>
<span>To find out practises of cunning hell,</span> <i class="place">1.3.113</i><br>

<span>From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,</span> <i class="place">1.3.144</i><br>
<span>That I have passed.</span> <i class="place">1.3.145</i><br>
<span>I ran it through, even from my boyish days,</span> <i class="place">1.3.146</i><br>
<span>To the very moment that he bade me tell it;</span> <i class="place">1.3.147</i><br>
<span>Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,</span> <i class="place">1.3.148</i><br>
<span>Of moving accidents by flood and field</span> <i class="place">1.3.149</i><br>
<span>Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,</span> <i class="place">1.3.150</i><br>
<span>Of being taken by the insolent foe</span> <i class="place">1.3.151</i><br>
<span>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence</span> <i class="place">1.3.152</i><br>
<span>And portance in my travels' history:</span> <i class="place">1.3.153</i><br>
<span>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</span> <i class="place">1.3.154</i><br>
<span>Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven</span> <i class="place">1.3.155</i><br>
<span>It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;</span> <i class="place">1.3.156</i><br>
<span>And of the Cannibals that each other eat,</span> <i class="place">1.3.157</i><br>
<span>The Anthropophagi and men whose heads</span> <i class="place">1.3.158</i><br>

<span>Would Desdemona seriously incline:</span> <i class="place">1.3.160</i><br>

<span>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,</span> <i class="place">1.3.162</i><br>
<span>She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear</span> <i class="place">1.3.163</i><br>
<span>Devour up my discourse: which I observing,</span> <i class="place">1.3.164</i><br>
<span>Took once a pliant hour, and found good means</span> <i class="place">1.3.165</i><br>
<span>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</span> <i class="place">1.3.166</i><br>
<span>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</span> <i class="place">1.3.167</i><br>
<span>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</span> <i class="place">1.3.168</i><br>
<span>But not intentively: I did consent,</span> <i class="place">1.3.169</i><br>
<span>And often did beguile her of her tears,</span> <i class="place">1.3.170</i><br>
<span>When I did speak of some distressful stroke</span> <i class="place">1.3.171</i><br>
<span>That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,</span> <i class="place">1.3.172</i><br>
<span>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</span> <i class="place">1.3.173</i><br>
<span>She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,</span> <i class="place">1.3.174</i><br>
<span>'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:</span> <i class="place">1.3.175</i><br>
<span>She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd</span> <i class="place">1.3.176</i><br>
<span>That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,</span> <i class="place">1.3.177</i><br>
<span>And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</span> <i class="place">1.3.178</i><br>
<span>I should but teach him how to tell my story.</span> <i class="place">1.3.179</i><br>
<span>And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</span> <i class="place">1.3.180</i><br>
<span>She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,</span> <i class="place">1.3.181</i><br>

<span>Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers</span> <i class="place">1.3.217</i><br>
<span>Into your favour.</span> <i class="place">1.3.218</i><br>
<span>When remedies are past, the griefs are ended</span> <i class="place">1.3.219</i><br>

<span>That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.</span> <i class="place">1.3.232</i><br>
<span>These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,</span> <i class="place">1.3.233</i><br>

<span>My Desdemona must I leave to thee:</span> <i class="place">1.3.319</i><br>
<span>I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:</span> <i class="place">1.3.320</i><br>
<span>And bring them after in the best advantage.</span> <i class="place">1.3.321</i><br>
<span>Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour</span> <i class="place">1.3.322</i><br>
<span>Of love, of worldly matters and direction,</span> <i class="place">1.3.323</i><br>
<span>To spend with thee: we must obey the time.</span> <i class="place">1.3.324</i><br>
<p><i>Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA</i></p>

<br>
<span>Iago,--</span> <i class="place">1.3.325</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>What say'st thou, noble heart?</span> <i class="place">1.3.326</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>What will I do, thinkest thou?</span> <i class="place">1.3.327</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Why, go to bed, and sleep.</span> <i class="place">1.3.328</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>I will incontinently drown myself.</span> <i class="place">1.3.329</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,</span> <i class="place">1.3.330</i><br>
<span>thou silly gentleman!</span> <i class="place">1.3.331</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and</span> <i class="place">1.3.332</i><br>
<span>then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.</ <i class="place">1.3.333</i>span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four</span> <i class="place">1.3.334</i><br>
<span>times seven years; and since I could distinguish</span> <i class="place">1.3.335</i><br>
<span>betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man</span> <i class="place">1.3.336</i><br>
<span>that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I</span> <i class="place">1.3.337</i><br>
<span>would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I</span> <i class="place">1.3.338</i><br>
<span>would change my humanity with a baboon.</span> <i class="place">1.3.339</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so</span> <i class="place">1.3.340</i><br>
<span>fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.</span> <i class="place">1.3.341</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus</span> <i class="place">1.3.342</i><br>
<span>or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which</span> <i class="place">1.3.343</i><br>
<span>our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant</span> <i class="place">1.3.344</i><br>
<span>nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up</span> <i class="place">1.3.345</i><br>
<span>thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or</span> <i class="place">1.3.346</i><br>
<span>distract it with many, either to have it sterile</span> <i class="place">1.3.347</i><br>
<span>with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the</span> <i class="place">1.3.348</i><br>
<span>power and corrigible authority of this lies in our</span> <i class="place">1.3.349</i><br>
<span>wills. If the balance of our lives had not one</span> <i class="place">1.3.350</i><br>
<span>scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the</span> <i class="place">1.3.351</i><br>
<span>blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us</span> <i class="place">1.3.352</i><br>
<span>to most preposterous conclusions: but we have</span> <i class="place">1.3.353</i><br>
<span>reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal</span> <i class="place">1.3.354</i><br>
<span>stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that</span> <i class="place">1.3.355</i><br>
<span>you call love to be a sect or scion.</span> <i class="place">1.3.356</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>It cannot be.</span> <i class="place">1.3.357</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of</span> <i class="place">1.3.358</i><br>
<span>the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown</span> <i class="place">1.3.359</i><br>
<span>cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy</span> <i class="place">1.3.360</i><br>
<span>friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with</span> <i class="place">1.3.361</i><br>
<span>cables of perdurable toughness; I could never</span> <i class="place">1.3.362</i><br>
<span>better stead thee than now. Put money in thy</span> <i class="place">1.3.363</i><br>
<span>purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with</span> <i class="place">1.3.364</i><br>
<span>an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It</span> <i class="place">1.3.365</i><br>
<span>cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her</span> <i class="place">1.3.366</i><br>
<span>love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he</span> <i class="place">1.3.367</i><br>
<span>his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou</span> <i class="place">1.3.368</i><br>
<span>shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but</span> <i class="place">1.3.369</i><br>
<span>money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in</span> <i class="place">1.3.370</i><br>
<span>their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food</span> <i class="place">1.3.371</i><br>
<span>that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be</span> <i class="place">1.3.372</i><br>
<span>to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must</span> <i class="place">1.3.373</i><br>
<span>change for youth: when she is sated with his body,</span> <i class="place">1.3.374</i><br>
<span>she will find the error of her choice: she must</span> <i class="place">1.3.375</i><br>
<span>have change, she must: therefore put money in thy</span> <i class="place">1.3.376</i><br>
<span>purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a</span> <i class="place">1.3.377</i><br>
<span>more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money</span> <i class="place">1.3.378</i><br>
<span>thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt</span> <i class="place">1.3.379</i><br>
<span>an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not</span> <i class="place">1.3.380</i><br>
<span>too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou</span> <i class="place">1.3.381</i><br>
<span>shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of</span> <i class="place">1.3.382</i><br>
<span>drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek</span> <i class="place">1.3.383</i><br>
<span>thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than</span> <i class="place">1.3.384</i><br>
<span>to be drowned and go without her.</span> <i class="place">1.3.385</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on</span> <i class="place">1.3.386</i><br>
<span>the issue?</span> <i class="place">1.3.387</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told</span> <i class="place">1.3.388</i><br>
<span>thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I</span> <i class="place">1.3.389</i><br>
<span>hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no</span> <i class="place">1.3.390</i><br>
<span>less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge</span> <i class="place">1.3.391</i><br>
<span>against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost</span> <i class="place">1.3.392</i><br>
<span>thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many</span> <i class="place">1.3.393</i><br>
<span>events in the womb of time which will be delivered.</span> <i class="place">1.3.394</i><br>
<span>Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more</span> <i class="place">1.3.395</i><br>
<span>of this to-morrow. Adieu.</span> <i class="place">1.3.396</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>Where shall we meet i' the morning?</span> <i class="place">1.3.397</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>At my lodging.</span> <i class="place">1.3.398</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>I'll be with thee betimes.</span> <i class="place">1.3.399</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?</span> <i class="place">1.3.400</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>What say you?</span> <i class="place">1.3.401</i><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>No more of drowning, do you hear?</span> <i class="place">1.3.402</i><br>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<span>I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.</span> <i class="place">1.3.403</i><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span>Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:</span> <i class="place">1.3.404</i><br>
<span>For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,</span> <i class="place">1.3.405</i><br>
<span>If I would time expend with such a snipe.</span> <i class="place">1.3.406</i><br>
<span>But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:</span> <i class="place">1.3.407</i><br>
<span>And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets</span> <i class="place">1.3.408</i><br>
<span>He has done my office: I know not if't be true;</span> <i class="place">1.3.409</i><br>
<span>But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,</span> <i class="place">1.3.410</i><br>
<span>Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;</span> <i class="place">1.3.411</i><br>
<span>The better shall my purpose work on him.</span> <i class="place">1.3.412</i><br>
<span>Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:</span> <i class="place">1.3.413</i><br>
<span>To get his place and to plume up my will</span> <i class="place">1.3.414</i><br>
<span>In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--</span> <i class="place">1.3.415</i><br>
<span>After some time, to abuse Othello's ear</span> <i class="place">1.3.416</i><br>
<span>That he is too familiar with his wife.</span> <i class="place">1.3.417</i><br>
<span>He hath a person and a smooth dispose</span> <i class="place">1.3.418</i><br>
<span>To be suspected, framed to make women false.</span> <i class="place">1.3.419</i><br>
<span>The Moor is of a free and open nature,</span> <i class="place">1.3.420</i><br>
<span>That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,</span> <i class="place">1.3.421</i><br>
<span>And will as tenderly be led by the nose</span> <i class="place">1.3.422</i><br>
<span>As asses are.</span> <i class="place">1.3.423</i><br>
<span>I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night</span> <i class="place">1.3.424</i><br>
<span>Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.</span> <i class="place">1.3.425</i><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
