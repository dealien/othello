<h3>ACT I</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</i>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.1">Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly</p>
<p name="1.1.2">That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</p>
<p name="1.1.3">As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.4">'Sblood, but you will not hear me:</p>
<p name="1.1.5">If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</p>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.6">Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.7">Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</p>
<p name="1.1.8">In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</p>
<p name="1.1.9">Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,</p>
<p name="1.1.10">I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</p>
<p name="1.1.11">But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</p>
<p name="1.1.12">Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</p>
<p name="1.1.13">Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;</p>
<p name="1.1.14">And, in conclusion,</p>
<p name="1.1.15">Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,</p>
<p name="1.1.16">'I have already chose my officer.'</p>
<p name="1.1.17">And what was he?</p>
<p name="1.1.18">Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</p>
<p name="1.1.19">One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</p>
<p name="1.1.20">A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;</p>
<p name="1.1.21">That never set a squadron in the field,</p>
<p name="1.1.22">Nor the division of a battle knows</p>
<p name="1.1.23">More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</p>
<p name="1.1.24">Wherein the toged consuls can propose</p>
<p name="1.1.25">As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</p>
<p name="1.1.26">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</p>
<p name="1.1.27">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</p>
<p name="1.1.28">At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</p>
<p name="1.1.29">Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</p>
<p name="1.1.30">By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</p>
<p name="1.1.31">He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</p>
<p name="1.1.32">And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</p>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.33">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.34">Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</p>
<p name="1.1.35">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</p>
<p name="1.1.36">And not by old gradation, where each second</p>
<p name="1.1.37">Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</p>
<p name="1.1.38">Whether I in any just term am affined</p>
<p name="1.1.39">To love the Moor.</p>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.40">I would not follow him then.</p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.41">O, sir, content you;</p>
<p name="1.1.42">I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</p>
<p name="1.1.43">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</p>
<p name="1.1.44">Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</p>
<p name="1.1.45">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</p>
<p name="1.1.46">That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</p>
<p name="1.1.47">Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</p>
<p name="1.1.48">For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</p>
<p name="1.1.49">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</p>
<p name="1.1.50">Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</p>
<p name="1.1.51">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</p>
<p name="1.1.52">And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</p>
<p name="1.1.53">Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</p>
<p name="1.1.54">their coats</p>
<p name="1.1.55">Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</p>
<p name="1.1.56">And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</p>
<p name="1.1.57">It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</p>
<p name="1.1.58">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</p>
<p name="1.1.59">In following him, I follow but myself;</p>
<p name="1.1.60">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</p>
<p name="1.1.61">But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</p>
<p name="1.1.62">For when my outward action doth demonstrate</p>
<p name="1.1.63">The native act and figure of my heart</p>
<p name="1.1.64">In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</p>
<p name="1.1.65">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</p>
<p name="1.1.66">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</p>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.67">What a full fortune does the thicklips owe</p>
<p name="1.1.68">If he can carry't thus!</p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.69">Call up her father,</p>
<p name="1.1.70">Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,</p>
<p name="1.1.71">Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</p>
<p name="1.1.72">And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</p>
<p name="1.1.73">Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</p>
<p name="1.1.74">Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,</p>
<p name="1.1.75">As it may lose some colour.</p>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.76">Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.</p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.77">Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</p>
<p name="1.1.78">As when, by night and negligence, the fire</p>
<p name="1.1.79">Is spied in populous cities.</p>
<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.80">What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.81">Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!</p>
<p name="1.1.82">Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!</p>
<p name="1.1.83">Thieves! thieves!</p>
<p><i>BRABANTIO appears above, at a window</i></p>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.84">What is the reason of this terrible summons?</p>

<b>RODERIGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.86">Signior, is all your family within?</p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>

<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

<p name="1.1.89">'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on</p>
<p name="1.1.90">your gown;</p>
<p name="1.1.91">Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</p>
<p name="1.1.92">Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</p>
<p name="1.1.93">Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;</p>
<p name="1.1.94">Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</p>
<p name="1.1.95">Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:</p>
<p name="1.1.96">Arise, I say.</p>
<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>

<br>

<b>BRABANTIO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.101">The worser welcome:</p>
<p name="1.1.102">I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:</p>
<p name="1.1.103">In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</p>
<p name="1.1.104">My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,</p>
<p name="1.1.105">Being full of supper and distempering draughts,</p>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.1.117">'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not</p>
<p name="1.1.118">serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to</p>
<p name="1.1.119">do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll</p>
<p name="1.1.120">have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;</p>
<p name="1.1.121">you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have</p>

<p name="1.1.142">Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</p>
<p name="1.1.143">I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</p>
<p name="1.1.144">Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</p>
<p name="1.1.145">In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</p>
<p name="1.1.146">Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:</p>

<p name="1.1.157">To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--</p>

<p name="1.1.172">And what's to come of my despised time</p>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<p name="1.3.342">Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus</p>
<p name="1.3.343">or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which</p>
<p name="1.3.344">our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant</p>

<p name="1.3.372">that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be</p>

<p name="1.3.375">she will find the error of her choice: she must</p>
<p name="1.3.376">have change, she must: therefore put money in thy</p>
