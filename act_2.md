<h3>ACT II</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen</i>
<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.1">What from the cape can you discern at sea?</span><br>
<br>

<b>First Gentleman</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.2">Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;</span><br>
<span name="2.1.3">I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.4">Descry a sail.</span><br>
<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.5">Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;</span><br>
<span name="2.1.6">A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:</span><br>
<span name="2.1.7">If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.8">What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.9">Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Second Gentleman</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.10">A segregation of the Turkish fleet:</span><br>
<span name="2.1.11">For do but stand upon the foaming shore,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.12">The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;</span><br>
<span name="2.1.13">The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.14">seems to cast water on the burning bear,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.15">And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:</span><br>
<span name="2.1.16">I never did like molestation view</span><br>
<span name="2.1.17">On the enchafed flood.</span><br>
<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.18">If that the Turkish fleet</span><br>
<span name="2.1.19">Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:</span><br>
<span name="2.1.20">It is impossible they bear it out.</span><br>
<p><i>Enter a third Gentleman</i></p>
<br>

<b>Third Gentleman</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.21">News, lads! our wars are done.</span><br>
<span name="2.1.22">The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.23">That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice</span><br>
<span name="2.1.24">Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance</span><br>
<span name="2.1.25">On most part of their fleet.</span><br>
<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.26">How! is this true?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Third Gentleman</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.27">The ship is here put in,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.28">A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.29">Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.30">Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.31">And is in full commission here for Cyprus.</span><br>
<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.32">I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.</span><br>
<br>

<b>Third Gentleman</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.33">But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort</span><br>
<span name="2.1.34">Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.35">And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted</span><br>
<span name="2.1.36">With foul and violent tempest.</span><br>
<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.37">Pray heavens he be;</span><br>
<span name="2.1.38">For I have served him, and the man commands</span><br>
<span name="2.1.39">Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!</span><br>
<span name="2.1.40">As well to see the vessel that's come in</span><br>
<span name="2.1.41">As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.42">Even till we make the main and the aerial blue</span><br>
<span name="2.1.43">An indistinct regard.</span><br>
<br>

<b>Third Gentleman</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.44">Come, let's do so:</span><br>
<span name="2.1.45">For every minute is expectancy</span><br>
<span name="2.1.46">Of more arrivance.</span><br>
<p><i>Enter CASSIO</i></p>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.47">Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.48">That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens</span><br>
<span name="2.1.49">Give him defence against the elements,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.50">For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.</span><br>
<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.51">Is he well shipp'd?</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.52">His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot</span><br>
<span name="2.1.53">Of very expert and approved allowance;</span><br>
<span name="2.1.54">Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.55">Stand in bold cure.</span><br>
<p><i>A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'</i></p>
<p><i>Enter a fourth Gentleman</i></p>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.56">What noise?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Fourth Gentleman</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.57">The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea</span><br>
<span name="2.1.58">Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.59">My hopes do shape him for the governor.</span><br>
<p><i>Guns heard</i></p>
<br>

<b>Second Gentlemen</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.60">They do discharge their shot of courtesy:</span><br>
<span name="2.1.61">Our friends at least.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.62">I pray you, sir, go forth,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.63">And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.</span><br>
<br>

<b>Second Gentleman</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.64">I shall.</span><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.65">But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.66">Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid</span><br>
<span name="2.1.67">That paragons description and wild fame;</span><br>
<span name="2.1.68">One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.69">And in the essential vesture of creation</span><br>
<span name="2.1.70">Does tire the ingener.</span><br>
<p><i>Re-enter second Gentleman</i></p>
<span name="2.1.71">How now! who has put in?</span><br>
<br>

<b>Second Gentleman</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.72">'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.73">Has had most favourable and happy speed:</span><br>
<span name="2.1.74">Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.75">The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--</span><br>
<span name="2.1.76">Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--</span><br>
<span name="2.1.77">As having sense of beauty, do omit</span><br>
<span name="2.1.78">Their mortal natures, letting go safely by</span><br>
<span name="2.1.79">The divine Desdemona.</span><br>
<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.80">What is she?</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.81">She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.82">Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.83">Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts</span><br>
<span name="2.1.84">A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.85">And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.86">That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.87">Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.88">Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits</span><br>
<span name="2.1.89">And bring all Cyprus comfort!</span><br>
<p><i>Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants</i></p>
<span name="2.1.90">O, behold,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.91">The riches of the ship is come on shore!</span><br>
<span name="2.1.92">Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.</span><br>
<span name="2.1.93">Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.94">Before, behind thee, and on every hand,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.95">Enwheel thee round!</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.96">I thank you, valiant Cassio.</span><br>
<span name="2.1.97">What tidings can you tell me of my lord?</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.98">He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught</span><br>
<span name="2.1.99">But that he's well and will be shortly here.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.100">O, but I fear--How lost you company?</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.101">The great contention of the sea and skies</span><br>
<span name="2.1.102">Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.</span><br>
<p><i>Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard</i></p>
<br>

<b>Second Gentleman</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.103">They give their greeting to the citadel;</span><br>
<span name="2.1.104">This likewise is a friend.</span><br>
<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.105">See for the news.</span><br>
<p><i>Exit Gentleman</i></p>
<span name="2.1.106">Good ancient, you are welcome.</span><br>
<p><i>To EMILIA</i></p>
<span name="2.1.107">Welcome, mistress.</span><br>
<span name="2.1.108">Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.109">That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding</span><br>
<span name="2.1.110">That gives me this bold show of courtesy.</span><br>
<p><i>Kissing her</i></p>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.111">Sir, would she give you so much of her lips</span><br>
<span name="2.1.112">As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.113">You'll have enough.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.114">Alas, she has no speech.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.115">In faith, too much;</span><br>
<span name="2.1.116">I find it still, when I have list to sleep:</span><br>
<span name="2.1.117">Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.118">She puts her tongue a little in her heart,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.119">And chides with thinking.</span><br>
<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.120">You have little cause to say so.</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.121">Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.122">Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.123">Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.124">Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.126">Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:</span><br>

<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.132">O gentle lady, do not put me to't;</span><br>

<span name="2.1.138">Come, how wouldst thou praise me?</span><br>
<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.139">I am about it; but indeed my invention</span><br>
<span name="2.1.140">Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;</span><br>
<span name="2.1.141">It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.142">And thus she is deliver'd.</span><br>
<span name="2.1.143">If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,</span><br>
<span name="2.1.144">The one's for use, the other useth it.</span><br>
<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.150">She never yet was foolish that was fair;</span><br>
<span name="2.1.151">For even her folly help'd her to an heir.</span><br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>

<br>

<b>IAGO</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.155">There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,</span><br>

<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>
<br>
<span name="2.1.157">O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.</span><br>
<span name="2.1.158">But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving</span><br>
<span name="2.1.159">woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her</span><br>

<span name="2.3.371">How poor are they that have not patience!</span><br>
<span name="2.3.372">What wound did ever heal but by degrees?</span><br>
<span name="2.3.373">Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;</span><br>
<span name="2.3.374">And wit depends on dilatory time.</span><br>
<span name="2.3.375">Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.</span><br>
<span name="2.3.376">And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:</span><br>
<span name="2.3.377">Though other things grow fair against the sun,</span><br>
<span name="2.3.378">Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:</span><br>
<span name="2.3.379">Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;</span><br>
<span name="2.3.380">Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.</span><br>
<span name="2.3.381">Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:</span><br>
<span name="2.3.382">Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:</span><br>
<span name="2.3.383">Nay, get thee gone.</span><br>
<p><i>Exit RODERIGO</i></p>
<span name="2.3.384">Two things are to be done:</span><br>
<span name="2.3.385">My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;</span><br>
<span name="2.3.386">I'll set her on;</span><br>
<span name="2.3.387">Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,</span><br>
<span name="2.3.388">And bring him jump when he may Cassio find</span><br>
<span name="2.3.389">Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way</span><br>
<span name="2.3.390">Dull not device by coldness and delay.</span><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
