<h3>ACT II</h3>
<h3>SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen</i><br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

What from the cape can you discern at sea?<br>

<b>First Gentleman</b>

Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;<br>
I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,<br>
Descry a sail.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;<br>
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:<br>
If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,<br>
What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,<br>
Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?<br>

<b>Second Gentleman</b>

A segregation of the Turkish fleet:<br>
For do but stand upon the foaming shore,<br>
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;<br>
The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,<br>
seems to cast water on the burning bear,<br>
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:<br>
I never did like molestation view<br>
On the enchafed flood.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

If that the Turkish fleet<br>
Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:<br>
It is impossible they bear it out.<br>
<p><i>Enter a third Gentleman</i><br></p>

<b>Third Gentleman</b>

News, lads! our wars are done.<br>
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,<br>
That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice<br>
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance<br>
On most part of their fleet.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

How! is this true?<br>

<b>Third Gentleman</b>

The ship is here put in,<br>
A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,<br>
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,<br>
Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,<br>
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.<br>

<b>Third Gentleman</b>

But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort<br>
Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,<br>
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted<br>
With foul and violent tempest.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

Pray heavens he be;<br>
For I have served him, and the man commands<br>
Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!<br>
As well to see the vessel that's come in<br>
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,<br>
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue<br>
An indistinct regard.<br>

<b>Third Gentleman</b>

Come, let's do so:<br>
For every minute is expectancy<br>
Of more arrivance.<br>
<p><i>Enter CASSIO</i><br></p>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,<br>
That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens<br>
Give him defence against the elements,<br>
For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

Is he well shipp'd?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot<br>
Of very expert and approved allowance;<br>
Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,<br>
Stand in bold cure.<br>
<p><i>A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'</i><br></p>
<p><i>Enter a fourth Gentleman</i><br></p>

<b>CASSIO</b>

What noise?<br>

<b>Fourth Gentleman</b>

The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea<br>
Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

My hopes do shape him for the governor.<br>
<p><i>Guns heard</i><br></p>

<b>Second Gentlemen</b>

They do discharge their shot of courtesy:<br>
Our friends at least.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I pray you, sir, go forth,<br>
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.<br>

<b>Second Gentleman</b>

I shall.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>

<b>MONTANO</b>

But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid<br>
That paragons description and wild fame;<br>
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,<br>
And in the essential vesture of creation<br>
Does tire the ingener.<br>
<p><i>Re-enter second Gentleman</i><br></p>
How now! who has put in?<br>

<b>Second Gentleman</b>

'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Has had most favourable and happy speed:<br>
Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,<br>
The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--<br>
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--<br>
As having sense of beauty, do omit<br>
Their mortal natures, letting go safely by<br>
The divine Desdemona.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

What is she?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,<br>
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,<br>
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts<br>
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,<br>
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,<br>
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,<br>
Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,<br>
Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits<br>
And bring all Cyprus comfort!<br>
<p><i>Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants</i><br></p>
O, behold,<br>
The riches of the ship is come on shore!<br>
Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.<br>
Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,<br>
Before, behind thee, and on every hand,<br>
Enwheel thee round!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I thank you, valiant Cassio.<br>
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught<br>
But that he's well and will be shortly here.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

O, but I fear--How lost you company?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

The great contention of the sea and skies<br>
Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.<br>
<p><i>Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard</i><br></p>

<b>Second Gentleman</b>

They give their greeting to the citadel;<br>
This likewise is a friend.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

See for the news.<br>
<p><i>Exit Gentleman</i><br></p>
Good ancient, you are welcome.<br>
<p><i>To EMILIA</i><br></p>
Welcome, mistress.<br>
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,<br>
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding<br>
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.<br>
<p><i>Kissing her</i><br></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

Sir, would she give you so much of her lips<br>
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,<br>
You'll have enough.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Alas, she has no speech.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

In faith, too much;<br>
I find it still, when I have list to sleep:<br>
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,<br>
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,<br>
And chides with thinking.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

You have little cause to say so.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,<br>
Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,<br>
Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,<br>
Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

O, fie upon thee, slanderer!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:<br>
You rise to play and go to bed to work.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

You shall not write my praise.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

No, let me not.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst<br>
praise me?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

O gentle lady, do not put me to't;<br>
For I am nothing, if not critical.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Ay, madam.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

I am not merry; but I do beguile<br>
The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.<br>
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I am about it; but indeed my invention<br>
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;<br>
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,<br>
And thus she is deliver'd.<br>
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,<br>
The one's for use, the other useth it.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Well praised! How if she be black and witty?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

If she be black, and thereto have a wit,<br>
She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Worse and worse.<br>

<b>EMILIA</b>

How if fair and foolish?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

She never yet was foolish that was fair;<br>
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'<br>
the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for<br>
her that's foul and foolish?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,<br>
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.<br>
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving<br>
woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her<br>
merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

She that was ever fair and never proud,<br>
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,<br>
Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,<br>
Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'<br>
She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,<br>
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,<br>
She that in wisdom never was so frail<br>
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;<br>
She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,<br>
See suitors following and not look behind,<br>
She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

To do what?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn<br>
of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say<br>
you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal<br>
counsellor?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in<br>
the soldier than in the scholar.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

[Aside]  He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,<br>
whisper: with as little a web as this will I<br>
ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon<br>
her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.<br>
You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as<br>
these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had<br>
been better you had not kissed your three fingers so<br>
oft, which now again you are most apt to play the<br>
sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent<br>
courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers<br>
to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!<br>
<p><i>Trumpet within</i><br></p>
The Moor! I know his trumpet.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

'Tis truly so.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

Let's meet him and receive him.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Lo, where he comes!<br>
<p><i>Enter OTHELLO and Attendants</i><br></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

O my fair warrior!<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

                  My dear Othello!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

It gives me wonder great as my content<br>
To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!<br>
If after every tempest come such calms,<br>
May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!<br>
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas<br>
Olympus-high and duck again as low<br>
As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,<br>
'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,<br>
My soul hath her content so absolute<br>
That not another comfort like to this<br>
Succeeds in unknown fate.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

The heavens forbid<br>
But that our loves and comforts should increase,<br>
Even as our days do grow!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Amen to that, sweet powers!<br>
I cannot speak enough of this content;<br>
It stops me here; it is too much of joy:<br>
And this, and this, the greatest discords be<br>
<p><i>Kissing her</i><br></p>
That e'er our hearts shall make!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

[Aside]  O, you are well tuned now!<br>
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,<br>
As honest as I am.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Come, let us to the castle.<br>
News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks<br>
are drown'd.<br>
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?<br>
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;<br>
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,<br>
I prattle out of fashion, and I dote<br>
In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,<br>
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:<br>
Bring thou the master to the citadel;<br>
He is a good one, and his worthiness<br>
Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,<br>
Once more, well met at Cyprus.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants</i><br></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come<br>
hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base<br>
men being in love have then a nobility in their<br>
natures more than is native to them--list me. The<br>
lieutenant tonight watches on the court of<br>
guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is<br>
directly in love with him.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

With him! why, 'tis not possible.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.<br>
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,<br>
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:<br>
and will she love him still for prating? let not<br>
thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;<br>
and what delight shall she have to look on the<br>
devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of<br>
sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to<br>
give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,<br>
sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which<br>
the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these<br>
required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will<br>
find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,<br>
disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will<br>
instruct her in it and compel her to some second<br>
choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most<br>
pregnant and unforced position--who stands so<br>
eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio<br>
does? a knave very voluble; no further<br>
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of<br>
civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing<br>
of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,<br>
none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a<br>
finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and<br>
counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never<br>
present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the<br>
knave is handsome, young, and hath all those<br>
requisites in him that folly and green minds look<br>
after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman<br>
hath found him already.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

I cannot believe that in her; she's full of<br>
most blessed condition.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of<br>
grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never<br>
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou<br>
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst<br>
not mark that?<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue<br>
to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met<br>
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced<br>
together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these<br>
mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes<br>
the master and main exercise, the incorporate<br>
conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I<br>
have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;<br>
for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows<br>
you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find<br>
some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking<br>
too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what<br>
other course you please, which the time shall more<br>
favourably minister.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

Well.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply<br>
may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for<br>
even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to<br>
mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true<br>
taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So<br>
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by<br>
the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the<br>
impediment most profitably removed, without the<br>
which there were no expectation of our prosperity.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

I will do this, if I can bring it to any<br>
opportunity.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:<br>
I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

Adieu.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;<br>
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:<br>
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,<br>
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,<br>
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona<br>
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;<br>
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure<br>
I stand accountant for as great a sin,<br>
But partly led to diet my revenge,<br>
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor<br>
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof<br>
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;<br>
And nothing can or shall content my soul<br>
Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,<br>
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor<br>
At least into a jealousy so strong<br>
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,<br>
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash<br>
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,<br>
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,<br>
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--<br>
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--<br>
Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.<br>
For making him egregiously an ass<br>
And practising upon his peace and quiet<br>
Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:<br>
Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>
<h3>SCENE II. A street.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following</i><br>

<b>Herald</b>

It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant<br>
general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,<br>
importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,<br>
every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,<br>
some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and<br>
revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these<br>
beneficial news, it is the celebration of his<br>
nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be<br>
proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full<br>
liberty of feasting from this present hour of five<br>
till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the<br>
isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i><br></p>
<h3>SCENE III. A hall in the castle.</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants</i><br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:<br>
Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,<br>
Not to outsport discretion.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Iago hath direction what to do;<br>
But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye<br>
Will I look to't.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

                  Iago is most honest.<br>
Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest<br>
Let me have speech with you.<br>
<p><i>To DESDEMONA</i><br></p>
Come, my dear love,<br>
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;<br>
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.<br>
Good night.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants</i><br></p>
<p><i>Enter IAGO</i><br></p>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the<br>
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love<br>
of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:<br>
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and<br>
she is sport for Jove.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

She's a most exquisite lady.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of<br>
provocation.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

She is indeed perfection.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I<br>
have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace<br>
of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to<br>
the health of black Othello.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and<br>
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish<br>
courtesy would invent some other custom of<br>
entertainment.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for<br>
you.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was<br>
craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation<br>
it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,<br>
and dare not task my weakness with any more.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants<br>
desire it.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Where are they?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I'll do't; but it dislikes me.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

If I can fasten but one cup upon him,<br>
With that which he hath drunk to-night already,<br>
He'll be as full of quarrel and offence<br>
As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,<br>
Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,<br>
To Desdemona hath to-night caroused<br>
Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:<br>
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,<br>
That hold their honours in a wary distance,<br>
The very elements of this warlike isle,<br>
Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,<br>
And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,<br>
Am I to put our Cassio in some action<br>
That may offend the isle.--But here they come:<br>
If consequence do but approve my dream,<br>
My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.<br>
<p><i>Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wine</i><br></p>

<b>CASSIO</b>

'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am<br>
a soldier.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Some wine, ho!<br>
<p><i>Sings</i><br></p>
And let me the canakin clink, clink;<br>
And let me the canakin clink<br>
A soldier's a man;<br>
A life's but a span;<br>
Why, then, let a soldier drink.<br>
Some wine, boys!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

'Fore God, an excellent song.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are<br>
most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and<br>
your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing<br>
to your English.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead<br>
drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he<br>
gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle<br>
can be filled.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

To the health of our general!<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

O sweet England!<br>
King Stephen was a worthy peer,<br>
His breeches cost him but a crown;<br>
He held them sixpence all too dear,<br>
With that he call'd the tailor lown.<br>
He was a wight of high renown,<br>
And thou art but of low degree:<br>
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;<br>
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.<br>
Some wine, ho!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Will you hear't again?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that<br>
does those things. Well, God's above all; and there<br>
be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

It's true, good lieutenant.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor<br>
any man of quality,--I hope to be saved.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

And so do I too, lieutenant.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the<br>
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's<br>
have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive<br>
us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.<br>
Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my<br>
ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:<br>
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and<br>
speak well enough.<br>

<b>All</b>

Excellent well.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>

<b>MONTANO</b>

To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

You see this fellow that is gone before;<br>
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar<br>
And give direction: and do but see his vice;<br>
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,<br>
The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.<br>
I fear the trust Othello puts him in.<br>
On some odd time of his infirmity,<br>
Will shake this island.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

But is he often thus?<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:<br>
He'll watch the horologe a double set,<br>
If drink rock not his cradle.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

It were well<br>
The general were put in mind of it.<br>
Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature<br>
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,<br>
And looks not on his evils: is not this true?<br>
<p><i>Enter RODERIGO</i><br></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

[Aside to him]  How now, Roderigo!<br>
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.<br>
<p><i>Exit RODERIGO</i><br></p>

<b>MONTANO</b>

And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor<br>
Should hazard such a place as his own second<br>
With one of an ingraft infirmity:<br>
It were an honest action to say<br>
So to the Moor.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

                  Not I, for this fair island:<br>
I do love Cassio well; and would do much<br>
To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?<br>
<p><i>Cry within: 'Help! help!'</i><br></p>
<p><i>Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO</i><br></p>

<b>CASSIO</b>

You rogue! you rascal!<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

What's the matter, lieutenant?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

A knave teach me my duty!<br>
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

Beat me!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

       Dost thou prate, rogue?<br>
<p><i>Striking RODERIGO</i><br></p>

<b>MONTANO</b>

Nay, good lieutenant;<br>
<p><i>Staying him</i><br></p>
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Let me go, sir,<br>
Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

Come, come,<br>
you're drunk.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Drunk!<br>
<p><i>They fight</i><br></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

[Aside to RODERIGO]  Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.<br>
<p><i>Exit RODERIGO</i><br></p>
Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--<br>
Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;<br>
Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!<br>
<p><i>Bell rings</i><br></p>
Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!<br>
The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!<br>
You will be shamed for ever.<br>
<p><i>Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants</i><br></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

What is the matter here?<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.<br>
<p><i>Faints</i><br></p>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Hold, for your lives!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--<br>
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?<br>
Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?<br>
Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that<br>
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?<br>
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:<br>
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage<br>
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.<br>
Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle<br>
From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?<br>
Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,<br>
Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I do not know: friends all but now, even now,<br>
In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom<br>
Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--<br>
As if some planet had unwitted men--<br>
Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,<br>
In opposition bloody. I cannot speak<br>
Any beginning to this peevish odds;<br>
And would in action glorious I had lost<br>
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;<br>
The gravity and stillness of your youth<br>
The world hath noted, and your name is great<br>
In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,<br>
That you unlace your reputation thus<br>
And spend your rich opinion for the name<br>
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:<br>
Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--<br>
While I spare speech, which something now<br>
offends me,--<br>
Of all that I do know: nor know I aught<br>
By me that's said or done amiss this night;<br>
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,<br>
And to defend ourselves it be a sin<br>
When violence assails us.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

Now, by heaven,<br>
My blood begins my safer guides to rule;<br>
And passion, having my best judgment collied,<br>
Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,<br>
Or do but lift this arm, the best of you<br>
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know<br>
How this foul rout began, who set it on;<br>
And he that is approved in this offence,<br>
Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,<br>
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,<br>
Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,<br>
To manage private and domestic quarrel,<br>
In night, and on the court and guard of safety!<br>
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?<br>

<b>MONTANO</b>

If partially affined, or leagued in office,<br>
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,<br>
Thou art no soldier.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Touch me not so near:<br>
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth<br>
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;<br>
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth<br>
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.<br>
Montano and myself being in speech,<br>
There comes a fellow crying out for help:<br>
And Cassio following him with determined sword,<br>
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman<br>
Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:<br>
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,<br>
Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--<br>
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,<br>
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather<br>
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,<br>
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night<br>
I ne'er might say before. When I came back--<br>
For this was brief--I found them close together,<br>
At blow and thrust; even as again they were<br>
When you yourself did part them.<br>
More of this matter cannot I report:<br>
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:<br>
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,<br>
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,<br>
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received<br>
From him that fled some strange indignity,<br>
Which patience could not pass.<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

I know, Iago,<br>
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,<br>
Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee<br>
But never more be officer of mine.<br>
<p><i>Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended</i><br></p>
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!<br>
I'll make thee an example.<br>

<b>DESDEMONA</b>

What's the matter?<br>

<b>OTHELLO</b>

All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.<br>
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:<br>
Lead him off.<br>
<p><i>To MONTANO, who is led off</i><br></p>
Iago, look with care about the town,<br>
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.<br>
Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life<br>
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO</i><br></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

What, are you hurt, lieutenant?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Ay, past all surgery.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Marry, heaven forbid!<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost<br>
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of<br>
myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,<br>
Iago, my reputation!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

As I am an honest man, I thought you had received<br>
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than<br>
in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false<br>
imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without<br>
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,<br>
unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!<br>
there are ways to recover the general again: you<br>
are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in<br>
policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his<br>
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue<br>
to him again, and he's yours.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so<br>
good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so<br>
indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?<br>
and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse<br>
fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible<br>
spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,<br>
let us call thee devil!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

What was he that you followed with your sword? What<br>
had he done to you?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I know not.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Is't possible?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;<br>
a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men<br>
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away<br>
their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance<br>
revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus<br>
recovered?<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place<br>
to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me<br>
another, to make me frankly despise myself.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,<br>
the place, and the condition of this country<br>
stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;<br>
but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me<br>
I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,<br>
such an answer would stop them all. To be now a<br>
sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a<br>
beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is<br>
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,<br>
if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.<br>
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.<br>
I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife<br>
is now the general: may say so in this respect, for<br>
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the<br>
contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and<br>
graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune<br>
her help to put you in your place again: she is of<br>
so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,<br>
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more<br>
than she is requested: this broken joint between<br>
you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my<br>
fortunes against any lay worth naming, this<br>
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

You advise me well.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.<br>

<b>CASSIO</b>

I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will<br>
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:<br>
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I<br>
must to the watch.<br>
CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>

<b>IAGO</b>

And what's he then that says I play the villain?<br>
When this advice is free I give and honest,<br>
Probal to thinking and indeed the course<br>
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy<br>
The inclining Desdemona to subdue<br>
In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful<br>
As the free elements. And then for her<br>
To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,<br>
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,<br>
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,<br>
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,<br>
Even as her appetite shall play the god<br>
With his weak function. How am I then a villain<br>
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,<br>
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!<br>
When devils will the blackest sins put on,<br>
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,<br>
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool<br>
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes<br>
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,<br>
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,<br>
That she repeals him for her body's lust;<br>
And by how much she strives to do him good,<br>
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.<br>
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,<br>
And out of her own goodness make the net<br>
That shall enmesh them all.<br>
<p><i>Re-enter RODERIGO</i><br></p>
How now, Roderigo!<br>

<b>RODERIGO</b>

I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that<br>
hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is<br>
almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well<br>
cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall<br>
have so much experience for my pains, and so, with<br>
no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.<br>

<b>IAGO</b>

How poor are they that have not patience!<br>
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?<br>
Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;<br>
And wit depends on dilatory time.<br>
Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.<br>
And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:<br>
Though other things grow fair against the sun,<br>
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:<br>
Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;<br>
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.<br>
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:<br>
Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:<br>
Nay, get thee gone.<br>
<p><i>Exit RODERIGO</i><br></p>
Two things are to be done:<br>
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;<br>
I'll set her on;<br>
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,<br>
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find<br>
Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way<br>
Dull not device by coldness and delay.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i><br></p>
